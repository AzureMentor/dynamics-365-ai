# Creating topics for your bot

Topics define the conversation path used by your virtual agent bot. They can also be used as building blocks for designing the conversation path.

When you create a bot, AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent automatically includes several system topics that help you address common situations in a conversation: A customer greeting, escalation to a live agent, the end of the conversation, a confirmed success, and a confirmed failure. In addition, the Virtual Agent environment includes industry-specific topics depending on the template you used to create your bot. For example, the Retail template includes topics for specifying store hours or highlighting a promotion:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Built-in topics](media/create-topic-1.PNG)

## To create your own topic

1. On the Topics page, click **New topic** to display the **Create a new topic** screen.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![New topic](media/create-topic-2.PNG)

2. Specify a name, description, and one of more trigger phrases for the topic, and then click **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create topic](media/create-topic-3.PNG)

    A trigger phrase is a phrase that a customer enters in the chat window in a conversation with the virtual agent.
