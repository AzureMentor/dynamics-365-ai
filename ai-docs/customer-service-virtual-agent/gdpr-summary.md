# GDPR compliance for Virtual Agent for Customer Service

European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives people (known in the GDPR as data subjects) specific rights to their personal data, including the ability to: obtain copies of personal data, request corrections or deletions, receive personal data in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller, or to restrict processing of personal data.

A formal request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is called a Data Subject Request (DSR). [Learn more about DSR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/gdpr-dsr-azure).

   **Note:**   Because access to your bot is managed by your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant administrator, other users with admin permissions have access to your bot content.

## A note about requests to rectify personal data

    If a data subject asks you to rectify their personal data that resides in your organization, you and your organization must determine if it’s appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying the data might include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or removing personal data.

    You can use AD to manage Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service users' identities. Enterprise customers can manage DSR rectify requests, including limited editing features, per the nature of a given Microsoft service. As a data processor, Microsoft doesn't offer the ability to correct system-generated logs because these logs reflect factual activities and constitute a historical record of events within Microsoft services. [Learn more about DSR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/gdpr-dsr-azure).
3. Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various online services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can also remove data from the Microsoft Cloud and retain it on-premises or at another location.
