# Creating a bot

The starting point for creating a rich virtual agent experience is to create a bot using the AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent. The AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent includes built-in industry-specific templates that help you tailor the bot to your specific needs. For example, the Retail template includes a way to easily communicate store hours to customers.

## To create a bot

1. Launch the AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent in your browser to display the **Create a new bot** screen.

    AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent supports Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, and Chrome browsers.

2. Select the template you want to use, and specify a name and environment for the bot. Optionally, you can specify a business name. Then click **Create**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create a new bot](media/create-bot-2.PNG)

    AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent creates the bot and opens it in the Bot Designer.
