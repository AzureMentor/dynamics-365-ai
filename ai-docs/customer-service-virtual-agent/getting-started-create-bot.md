# Creating a bot

You can use the Virtual Agent Designer to create a powerful custom virtual agent. The Virtual Agent Designer makes it easy to create bots that addresses common customer support issues. You can design a conversation path that leads each customer to a resolution.

To help get you started and tailor the bot to your specific needs, the Virtual Agent Designer lets you create a bot using built-in industry-specific templates. For example, the Virtual Agent Designer includes a template to help you create a virtual agent for retail customers.

The templates come with an enhanced artificial intelligence model for that industry, as well as built-in content building blocks containing topics, trigger phrases, and pre-authored conversation paths that are tailored to that industry. For example, the Retail template includes a topic that lets you easily communicate store hours to customers.

These industry templates can also be useful as a model for building conversations around the support issues and requests that customers often face or request. For more information, see [Work with templates](how-to-templates.md).

## To create a bot

1. Launch the Virtual Agent Designer in your browser to display the **Create a new bot** screen.

    AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent supports Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome browsers.

   > ![Create a new bot screen](media/create-bot-1.PNG)

2. Select the template you want to use, and specify a name and region for the bot. Optionally, you can specify a business name. Then click **Create**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create a new bot](media/create-bot-2.PNG)

    Virtual Agent Designer creates the bot and opens it in the browser.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Open bot](media/create-bot-3.PNG)

Once you have created your bot, you can add topics to the bot that represent the customer intents that can be addressed by the virtual agent, and then deploy the bot to a web channel. As customers use the bot, you can view analytics information to help you improve the bot and the overall customer experience.
