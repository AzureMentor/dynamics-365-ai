# Creating a virtual agent

You can use the Virtual Agent Designer to create a powerful custom virtual agent. The Virtual Agent Designer makes it easy to create virtual agents that address common support issues. You can design a conversation path that leads each customer to a resolution.

To help get you started and tailor the virtual agent to your specific needs, the Virtual Agent Designer lets you create a virtual agent using built-in industry-specific templates. For example, the Virtual Agent Designer includes a template to help you create a virtual agent for a retail business.

Each template comes with built-in content building blocks containing topics, trigger phrases, and pre-authored conversation paths that are tailored to a specific industry. For example, the Retail template includes a topic that lets you easily communicate store hours to customers.

These industry templates can also be useful as a model for building your own conversations for similar customer-support issues. For more information, see [Work with templates](how-to-templates.md).

## To create a virtual agent

1. Open the Virtual Agent Designer in your browser to display the **Create a new bot** screen.

    AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent supports Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome browsers.

   > ![Create a new bot screen](media/create-bot-1.PNG)

2. Select the template you want to use, and specify a name and region for the bot. Optionally, you can specify a business name. Then select **Create**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create a new bot](media/create-bot-2.PNG)

    Virtual Agent Designer creates the bot and opens it in the browser.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Open bot](media/create-bot-3.PNG)

Once you have created your bot, you can add topics that represent the customer intents to be addressed by the virtual agent and then deploy the virtual agent to a web channel. As customers use the virtual agent, you can view analytics information to help you improve it and the overall customer experience.
