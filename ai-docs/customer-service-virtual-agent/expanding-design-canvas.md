# Working with the conversation editor design canvas

As you design the conversation path for your bot in the conversation editor, you often create a conversation path with multiple nodes and branches based on a customer's response to the options you specify. As the conversation path becomes more complex, it can become challenging to view and work with it in the conversation editor design canvas.

To help you work with a complex conversation path, Virtual Agent provides a variety of tools to expand the size of the design canvas, adjust the position of the conversation path, zoom in and out of the canvas, and orient the current view of the conversation path. You can:

* [Expand the size of the design canvas](#expand-the-size-of-the-design-canvas) by hiding the Test bot and navigation pane.
* [Adjust the position of the conversation path](#adjust-the-position-of-the-conversation-path) in the design canvas by using the horizontal scroll bar.
* [Zoom in and out of the design canvas](#zoom-in-and-out-of-the-design-canvas) by using the conversation editor's **Zoom in** and **Zoom out** buttons.
* [Orient the current view of the conversation path](#orient-the-current-view-of-the-conversation-path) within the conversation path as a whole by using the conversation editor's **Mini-map** button.

## Expand the size of the design canvas

When you open a topic in the conversation editor, Virtual Agent by default displays the Test bot and navigation panes along with the conversation editor design canvas.

To expand the size of the conversation editor design canvas, you can hide the Test bot and navigation panes.

To hide the Test bot pane, select **Hide bot** in the lower left corner of Virtual Agent.

   > ![Hide Test bot](media/expand-canvas-test.png)

To hide the navigation pane, select the navigation pane icon in the upper left corner of Virtual Agent.

   > ![Hide navigation pane](media/expand-canvas-nav.png)

After you hide the Test bot and navigation panes, the conversation editor design canvas uses the full Virtual Agent screen.

To restore the Test bot pane, select **Show bot** or the Show bot icon. To restore the navigation pane, select the navigation pane icon again.

## Adjust the position of the conversation path

If the width of your conversation path design exceeds the width of the design canvas, you can adjust the position of the conversation path in the design canvas using the conversation editor's horizontal scroll bar.

By moving the scroll bar to the right, the conversation path design can be positioned to fit in the design canvas.

## Zoom in and out of the design canvas

To help you view and navigate your conversation path, you can zoom in and out of the design canvas using the conversation editor's **Zoom in** and **Zoom out** buttons.

Select the **Zoom in** button to zoom in for a closer view of part of your conversation path.

   > ![Zoom in button](media/zoom-in.png)

Select the **Zoom out** button to zoom out for a big picture view of your conversation path.

   > ![Zoom out button](media/zoom-out.png)

To restore the design canvas to its original zoom level, select the **Reset** button.

   > ![Reset button](media/reset.png)

## Orient the current view of the conversation path

To help you orient the current view of the conversation path within the conversation path as a whole, you can use the conversation editor's **Mini-map** button.

First, select the **Mini-map** button.

   > ![Mini-map button](media/mini-map-button.png)

The conversation editor displays a graphic schematic of the conversation path with the current view highlighted.
