# Connect to your customer service data

The Virtual Agent Designer lets you quickly connect to your existing Dynamics 365 customer service data to give you insights that can help you improve your virtual agent. The Virtual Agent Designer uses artificial intelligence technology to group related support case titles as topics and then give you suggested trigger phrases that you can use when you are designing your virtual agent.

1. Display the **Connect your data** screen, using either the Suggested tab of the Topics page or the **Settings** button on the Virtual Agent title bar.

    To use the Suggested tab of the Topics page, select **Connect data** to display the **Connect your data** screen.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Virtual Agent configures the workspace to use the environment you selected.
