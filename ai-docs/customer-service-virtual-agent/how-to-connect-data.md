# Connect to your customer service data

Virtual Agent lets you quickly connect to your existing Dynamics 365 customer service data to give you insights that can help you improve your bot. It uses artificial intelligence technology to group related support case titles as topics and then give you suggested trigger phrases that you can use when you are designing your bot.

1. Display the **Connect your data** screen using the **Settings** button on the Virtual Agent title bar. Select **Data Connections** to display the Current connections pane of the Settings window.
