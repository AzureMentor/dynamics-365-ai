# AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent overview

Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent enables any customer-service manager to create a powerful custom virtual agent using the Virtual Agent Designer. The Virtual Agent Designer provides an easy, code-free graphical interface and templates for creating a virtual agent without the need for artificial intelligence experts or teams of developers. The virtual agent can chat with customers, ask the appropriate clarifying questions to identify issues, and guide each customer to a resolution.

Key features include:

* **An easy-to-use graphical interface** – Using a simple, no-code graphical interface, customer service managers and subject matter experts can easily build, manage, and maintain their own virtual agents. No artificial intelligence expertise, coding skills, or extensive engineering efforts are required. As new topics from customers emerge over time, a subject matter expert can update the virtual agent in minutes, without writing any code.

* **AI-driven conversations** – Customer service managers can create virtual agent solutions to support topics in the form of interactive multi-turn conversations. For complex topics that can have multiple solutions, customer service managers only need to specify the range of solutions and the conditions under which a solution applies. The AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent's artificial intelligence technology dynamically generates the appropriate multi-turn conversation to help provide a solution for the customer.

* **Continuous identification of new support topics** – In addition to helping customers find solutions, the virtual agent continuously identifies new support topics raised by customers. This insight allows customer service managers to quickly roll out solutions to new topics, creating a virtuous cycle that improves the customer's experience.

* **The ability to leverage human knowledge to scale conversations** – AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent makes it possible for professional developers to process chat transcripts generated during conversations between human agents and customers. You can extract information for high-volume support topics as well as successful solutions provided by human agents. You can tune the artificial intelligence model to suit your business, increasing the accuracy and coverage of topics served by the virtual agent.
