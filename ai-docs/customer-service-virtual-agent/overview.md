# Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service overview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service enables any customer-service manager to create a powerful custom bot. Virtual Agent provides an easy, code-free graphical interface and templates for creating a bot without the need for artificial intelligence experts or teams of developers. The bot can chat with customers, ask the appropriate clarifying questions to identify issues, and guide each customer to a resolution.

Key features include:

* **An easy-to-use graphical interface** – Using a simple, no-code graphical interface, customer service managers and subject matter experts can easily build, manage, and maintain their own bots. No artificial intelligence expertise, coding skills, or extensive engineering efforts are required. As new topics from customers emerge over time, a subject matter expert can update the bot in minutes, without writing any code.

* **AI-driven conversations** – Customer service managers can create bot solutions to support topics in the form of interactive multi-turn conversations. For complex topics that can have multiple solutions, customer service managers only need to specify the range of solutions and the conditions under which a solution applies. The Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service's artificial intelligence technology dynamically generates the appropriate multi-turn conversation to help provide a solution for the customer.

* **The ability to leverage human knowledge to scale conversations** – Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service makes it possible for professional developers to process chat transcripts generated during conversations between human agents and customers.
