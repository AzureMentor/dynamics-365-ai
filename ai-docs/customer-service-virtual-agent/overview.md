3. Enable rich, natural conversations. Microsoft’s powerful conversational AI capabilities enable your end users to have rich multi-turn conversations which quickly guide them to the right solution. And, unlike most products on the market, there’s no need to re-train AI models. All you need is to provide a few examples of what topic you want the bot to handle and you’re ready to go.
 
4. Enable bots to take action. Bots that can chat with your users are great, but bots that can act on their behalf are even better. With Virtual Agent for Customer Service, you can easily integrate with services and backend systems out-of-the-box or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using Microsoft Flow. This makes it simple to create a bot that not only responds to the user, but also takes action to resolve their issues.
