# AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent overview

Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent enables any customer service manager to create a powerful custom virtual agent using an easy, code-free graphical interface and templates, without the need for artificial intelligence experts or teams of developers. The Customer Service Virtual Agent can chat with customers, ask the appropriate clarifying questions to identify issues, and guide each customer to a resolution.

Key features include:

* **An easy-to-use graphical interface** – Using a simple, no-code graphical interface, customer service managers and subject matter experts can easily build, manage, and maintain their own virtual agents. Creating and working with virtual agents does not require  artificial intelligence expertise, coding skills, or extensive engineering effort. As resolutions change or new support topics arise, a customer service manager or subject matter expert can update the virtual agent in minutes, without writing any code.

AI-driven dialogs – Customer service managers can author solutions to support topics in the form of interactive multi-turn conversations. For complex topics that can have multiple solutions, customer service managers need only specify the range of solutions and the conditions in which a given solution applies. The Customer Service Virtual Agent's AI technology dynamically generates the appropriate multi-turn conversation to find and provide a solution for the customer.

Continually identifying new topics – The Virtual Agent not only helps customers with solutions, it continuously identifies new topics raised by customers that need solutions. This insight allows customer service managers to quickly roll out solutions to new topics, creating a virtuous cycle improving customer experience.

Leveraging human knowledge to scale dialogs – Customer Service Virtual Agent makes it possible for professional developers to process chat transcripts generated during conversations between human agents and customers. You can extract information for high-volume support topics as well as successful solutions provided by human agents. You can tune the AI model to specifically suit your business, increasing the accuracy and coverage of topics served by the Customer Service Virtual Agent.
