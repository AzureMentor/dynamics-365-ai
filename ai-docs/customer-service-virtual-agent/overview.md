# AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent overview

Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent is a new cloud service launching in public preview in April 2019. Built on the lessons learned by supporting multiple worldwide deployments of customer service bots, AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent puts the power of deploying solutions to problems through a virtual agent in the hands of the subject matter experts - your customer service team.  

AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent will be available in public preview in April 2019 and will be generally available in the second half of 2019.

The key features coming in the public preview include:

Quickly discover support topics to automate – Using the integrated AI for Customer Service Insights dashboards, quickly see where your human agents are spending the most time, and which issues are most costly or trending. Get suggestions from artificial intelligence on which issues to automate to have the most impact on the system.

Automate support topics with a virtual agent – Easily create a virtual agent to help automatically answer and resolve common issues using a simple, no-code graphical interface. You can create conversations from scratch, or use rich, industry-specific templates to get your virtual agent ready in minutes.

AI-driven dialogs – Virtual Agents can have multi-turn conversations without using a rigid step-by-step script authored by a customer service manager. Given a set of valid solutions and conditions, the AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent automatically uses the next best question to ask – guiding the user to the appropriate solution.

Actions – Not only can the Virtual Agent chat with users to troubleshoot their problems, it can also take actions on their behalf. Using Microsoft Flow, a customer service manager can enable an action or access data in your backend systems, leveraging hundreds of connectors to common services shipping as part of the Power Platform.

Work together with your human agents. When the Virtual Agent can’t handle a problem, or a user asks for a human agent, the Virtual Agent pulls in a human agent to help. Either use the integration with Dynamics 365 for Customer Service or integrate with your specific case management and agent messaging system.

AI-powered analytics for continuous improvement – You can always see how well the Virtual Agent is doing, which topics are handled, and which topics require human intervention. AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent continually provides analytics and recommends actions to improve the customer service experience, helping you free up time from your human agents to focus on more complex cases.
