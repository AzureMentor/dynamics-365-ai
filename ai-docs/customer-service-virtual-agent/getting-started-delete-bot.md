# Deleting your bot

If you want to remove your bot from the Virtual Agent environment, you can delete it using the **Delete Bot** command on the **Settings** menu.

## To delete a bot

1. Select the **Settings** button on the Virtual Agent title bar, and then select **General settings** to display the General pane of the Settings window.

   > ![Display General pane](media/general-settings.png)

2. In the Delete bot section, select **Delete bot**.

   > ![Delete bot](media/delete-bot.png)

Virtual Agent removes your bot from the system and opens the **Create a new bot** screen, giving you the opportunity to create a new bot.

For information about creating a bot, see [Creating a bot](getting-started-create-bot.md).
