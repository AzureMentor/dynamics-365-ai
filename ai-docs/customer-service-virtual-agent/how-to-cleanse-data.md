# Improve data quality by cleansing support case titles

If you have connected AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent to your existing Dynamics 365 customer service data, you can improve the topic trigger phrase suggestions generated by the Virtual Agent Designer's artificial intelligence technology by cleansing support case titles. The results can be misleading if the titles include extraneous information such as product name, case status, or ticket number tags. You can improve the quality of the results by specifying Data Cleansing settings to disregard tags in titles when they are grouped into topics.

For more information about topic suggestions, see [Use topic suggestions to improve your virtual agent](how-to-suggestions.md).

## To cleanse support case titles

1. Select the **Settings** button on the Virtual Agent Designer title bar and then select **Data Cleansing** to display the Case title cleansing pane of the Settings window.

2. Select the check box next to **I want to clean my case titles**

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Case Titles pane](media/how-to-cleanse-data-2.PNG)

3. Specify any delimiter characters you use to separate tags from each other or from the issue summary, and whether you place tags before or after the summary, or both. Then click **Save**.

The settings take effect when you refresh the workspace.
