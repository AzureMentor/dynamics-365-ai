# Hand off a bot conversation to a live human agent

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A bot can resolve many customer support issues, but there are times when an issue requires a live human agent. As you design the conversation path for your bot topic, you can initiate a handoff by redirecting users to the Escalate system topic. To get started, update the Escalate system topic.

## Update Escalate system topic to handoff to a live agent

1. Select **Topics** in the navigation pane to open the Topics page.

   ![Open Topics page](media/open-topics.png)

2. Hover over the Escalate system topic, and then select the **Edit** icon to open the topic in the conversation editor.

3. In the **Bot Says** box, replace the *[link]* placeholder with a link to your engagement hub chat canvas. Then select **Save** to save the topic.

   ![Save topic](media/replace-placeholder.png)

You are now ready to redirect users to this topic to initiate a handoff.

## Initiate hand-off to human agent from any user topic

1. Select **Topics** in the navigation pane to open the Topics page.

2. Open the topic where you want to add the handoff in the conversation editor. Navigate to where you want to trigger a handoff to live human agent, and then select **Escalate**.

    Virtual Agent adds an **Escalate** node to the conversation path.

3. Select **Save** to save the topic. 

Your topic now redirects to "Escalate" to initiate a handoff to human agent.
