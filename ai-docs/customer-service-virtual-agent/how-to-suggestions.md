# Use topic suggestions to improve your virtual agent

To help you make your virtual agent more useful to customers, the Virtual Agent Designer provides suggestions to improve the topics used by the virtual agent. If you are connected to your Dynamics 365 for Customer Service data, the Virtual Agent Designer uses artificial intelligence technology to group related customer support cases and suggest possible trigger phrases. Suggestions are also generated from improvements to Virtual Agent Designer templates over time.

## Using topic suggestions from your Dynamics 365 for Customer Service data

As you develop your virtual agent, you can take advantage of insights from the Visual Basic Designer applying artificial intelligence technology to your support case data. After you connect to your Dynamics 365 for Customer Service data, the Virtual Agent Designer uses language understanding to group related customer support cases and suggest trigger phrases.

You can connect to your data either on the Suggested tab of the Topics page or using the **Settings** button on the Virtual Agent title bar. For more information about connection to your data, see [Connect to your customer service data](how-to-connect-data.md).

## Using topic suggestions from improvements to Virtual Agent Designer templates

Topic suggestions are also generated from improvements to Virtual Agent Designer templates. For example, if you create a virtual agent using the Retail template and additional topics are added to the template after you create the virtual agent, the Virtual Agent Designer may suggest additional trigger phrases based on the added template topics.
