# Use topic suggestions to improve your virtual agent

To help you make your virtual agent more useful to customers, the Virtual Agent Designer provides suggestions to improve the topics used by the virtual agent. The suggestions are generated by applying artificial intelligence technology to your Dynamics 365 for Customer Service data, and from improvements to Virtual Agent Designer templates over time.

## Using topic suggestions from your Dynamics 365 for Customer Service data

As you develop your virtual agent, you can take advantage of suggestions generated by applying artificial intelligence technology to your support case data. After you connect to your Dynamics 365 for Customer Service data, the Virtual Agent Designer uses natural language understanding to group related customer support cases and suggest topics and trigger phrases.

You can connect to your data either on the Suggested tab of the Topics page or using the **Settings** button on the Virtual Agent title bar. To connect to your data on the Suggested tab of the Topics page, click **Connect data** to display the **Connect your data** screen.

For more information about connection to your data, see [Connect to your customer service data](how-to-connect-data.md).

Once you have connected to your customer service data, Virtual Agent Designer adds suggested topics and trigger phrases to the Suggested tab of the Topics page. The suggestions are generated from applying language understanding technology to support case titles.

   > ![Suggested topics](media/how-to-suggestions-1.PNG)

To improve the quality of the suggestions, it is a good idea to clean up support case titles. For example, the results can be misleading if the titles include extraneous information such as product name, case status, or ticket number tags. You can improve the quality of the results by specifying Data Cleansing settings to disregard tags in titles when they are grouped into topics.

For more information on data cleansing, see [Improve data quality by cleansing support case titles](how-to-cleanse-data.md).

After you cleanse your support case titles, Virtual Agent Designer refreshes the Suggested tab with the updated suggestions.

   > ![Cleansed topics](media/how-to-suggestions-2.PNG)

You can then review the suggestions list and either create a new topic from a suggestion or add trigger phrases to an existing topic.

For example, your customer service data might generate a suggestion called *Store Hours* with 18 trigger phrases.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Store hours suggestion](media/how-to-suggestions-3.PNG)

Select the suggestion to open the suggestion editor, which lists the trigger phrases generated by the Virtual Agent Designer's artificial intelligence technology and any existing topics that may be a good match for the trigger phrases.

### To add the trigger phrases to a topic

1. Select the topic and click **Add**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add trigger phrases](media/how-to-suggestions-4.PNG)

Virtual Agent Designer opens the topic in the topic editor and adds the trigger phrases to the Trigger phrases list. To save the trigger phrases, click **Save topic**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Save topic](media/how-to-suggestions-5.PNG)

Virtual Agent Designer updates the topic, and removes the suggestion from the suggestions list.

### To create a new topic

* Select **Create a new topic**, and then click **Add**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create new topic](media/how-to-suggestions-6.PNG)

Virtual Agent Designer adds the topic to the Topics list.

For more information on Creating a topic, see [Creating topics for your virtual agent](getting-started-create-topics.md).

## Using topic suggestions from improvements to Virtual Agent Designer templates

Topic suggestions are also generated from additions over time to Virtual Agent Designer templates. For example, if you create a virtual agent using the Retail template and topics are added to the template after you create the virtual agent, the Virtual Agent Designer suggests topics and trigger phrases based on the additional template topics.

As with the suggestions generated from connecting to your customer service data, you can either create a new topic from a suggestion or add trigger phrases to an existing topic using the steps above.
