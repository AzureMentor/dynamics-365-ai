# Using analytics to improve your virtual agent

As you create and deploy your Virtual Agent Designer virtual agent, you can use analytics to see how your virtual agent is performing. Virtual Agent Designer includes built-in dashboards, interactive charts, and visual filters that give you actionable insights into critical performance metrics, operational data, and emerging trends.

To view the analytics dashboards, click **Analytics** in the navigation pane to open the Analytics page.

You can display [Summary](analytics-summary.md), [Engagement](analytics-engagement.md), and [Customer satisfaction](analytics-csat.md) dashboards by clicking the tab for each dashboard on the Analytics page. The Summary dashboard is the default AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent dashboard.

* Filters to let you view customer service data for a specific time period.
* Key performance indicator charts that give you the basics of how your system is performing.
* Graphical charts showing trends and breakdowns of cases from a variety of views.
* Impact charts that use language understanding artificial intelligence technology to show the impact and trends of cases related to specific support topics.

## Dashboard filters

Filters on each dashboard let you view information for support cases for a specific time period.

By default, dashboards display information for the last seven days, but you also display information for the last 30 days by selecting **Last 30 Days**.

## Key performance indicator charts

Key performance indicator charts give you a view of the key performance data for your virtual agent and customer service system for the specified time period. For example, the key performance indicator charts on the Summary summary dashboard show you:

Abandon rate | The percentage of engaged sessions that are abandoned. An abandoned session is an engaged session that is neither resolved nor escalated after one hour from the beginning of the session.

* The total number of sessions during the period.
* The percentage of total sessions during the period that are engaged sessions.
* The percentage of engaged sessions during the period that are resolved.
* The percentage of engaged sessions during the period that are escalated.
* The percentage of engaged sessions during the period that are abandoned.
