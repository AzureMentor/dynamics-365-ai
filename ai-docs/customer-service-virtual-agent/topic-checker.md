# Validate a topic and address errors with the Topic Checker

The Topic Checker is available in the conversation editor for any topic defined for your bot. It allows you to see the health of a topic and shows the errors and warnings that have failed validation. You can select the listed errors or warnings to go to the node or field thatâ€™s failed validation. As you fix the errors, they will disappear from the Topic Checker, either automatically or after saving the topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can save topics with errors. The errors will persist until they are addressed on the topic. Topics with errors may be deployed to production. However, unexpected behavior may result.

## Topic errors
