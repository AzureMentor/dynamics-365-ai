# Work with templates

To help give you a jump start on creating and developing your virtual agent bots, AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent includes templates that provide built-in building blocks to help you develop your virtual agent's conversation path.

Each template comes with an enhanced artificial intelligence model for a specific industry, and built-in topics that you can use to build a conversation path tailored to that industry. For example, the Retail template includes topics for specifying store hours or highlighting a sales promotion.

The built-in topics supplied by the template can also be useful as a model for building your conversation path. 

## Using industry-specific templates to create your virtual agent

AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent templates include industry-specific topics that provide building blocks tailored to creating a virtual agent for that industry, as well as several system topics that help you address common situations -- a customer greeting, escalation to a live agent, the end of the conversation, a confirmed success, and a confirmed failure.

## Using template topics as a model for building your conversation path

A good starting point for creating a bot and designing its conversation path is to view the built-in topics that come with each template.

For example, to see an example of how to create a bot that gives a customer different responses for different options, go to the Topics page and open the Store hours topic in the design canvas.
