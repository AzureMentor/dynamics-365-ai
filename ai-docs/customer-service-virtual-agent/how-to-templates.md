# Work with templates

To help you create your custom virtual agent, the Virtual Agent Designer includes templates that provide built-in building blocks for developing the virtual agent's conversation path.

Each template comes with an artificial intelligence model for a specific industry and built-in system topics, as well as topics tailored to that industry. For example, the Virtual Agent Designer includes a template to help you create a virtual agent for a retail business.

The built-in topics supplied by the template can also be useful as a model for building your conversation path. The Virtual Agent Designer currently supports Retail and General customer support templates.

## Using templates to create your virtual agent

The Virtual Agent Designer templates provide a variety of built-in features that give you a head start on developing your virtual agent. For example, each template includes several system topics that help you address common situations. These include:

* A customer greeting
* Escalation to a live agent
* The end of the conversation
* A confirmed success
* A confirmed failure

The Virtual Agent Designer currently includes a General template that you can use to create any type of virtual agent for customer support, and a Retail template that provides a variety of topics specific to a retail business. These include topics related to:

* Looking up store hours
* Finding store locations
* Paying a bill
* Cancelling an order

## Using template topics as a model for building your conversation path

A good starting point for creating a virtual agent and designing its conversation path is to view the built-in topics that come with a template.

For example, to see how you might build a conversation path for helping customers find specific store information, view the Store Hours topic that is included with the Retail template.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![View Store Hours](media/how-to-templates-1.png)

To view the topic's conversation path, select the Store Hours topic in the Topics list to open the topic, and then click the **Edit** button to open the conversation editor.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Edit Store Hours](media/how-to-templates-2.png)

You can view the trigger phrases and conversation path design in the Store Hours topic, and use similar techniques in your own topics.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![View conversation path](media/how-to-templates-3.png)
