# Work with templates

The built-in topics supplied by the template can also be useful as a model for building your own topics. For example, to see an example of how to create a bot that gives a customer different responses for different options, go to the Topics page and open the Store hours topic in the design canvas.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Store hours topic](media/create-bot-1-1.PNG)
