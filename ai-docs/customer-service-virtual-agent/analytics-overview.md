# Analytics overview

The Dynamics 365 Customer Service Virtual Agent analytics dashboards contain a variety of charts that show you key performance indicators for your virtual agent, give you graphical views of the trends and breakdowns in your virtual agent's support cases, and use artificial intelligence technology to highlight support cases that are having the greatest impact on your virtual agent's performance.

You can display [Summary](analytics-summary.md), [Engagement](analytics-engagement.md), and [Customer satisfaction](analytics-CSAT.md) dashboards by selecting each dashboard's icon in the navigation pane. The Summary dashboard is the default Customer Service Virtual Agent dashboard.

You can display the [Topic details](analytics-topic-details.md) dashboard by selecting the Detail link in one of the charts in those dashboards.
