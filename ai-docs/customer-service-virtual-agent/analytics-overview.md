# Analytics overview

The AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent analytics dashboards contain a variety of charts that show you key performance indicators for your customer service system, give you graphical views of the trends and breakdowns in your system's support cases, and use artificial intelligence technology to highlight support cases that are having the greatest impact on the system.

You can display [Summary](analytics-summary.md), [Engagement](analytics-engagement.md), and [Customer satisfaction](analytics-CSAT.md) dashboards by clicking each dashboard's icon in the navigation pane. The Summary dashboard is the default AI for Customer Service Virtual Agent dashboard.

You can display the [Topic details](analytics-topic-details.md) dashboard by right-clicking a topic in one of the charts in those dashboards, hovering over **Drillthrough**, and then selecting **Topic Drill Through**.

You can also use the [Sessions page](analytics-sessions.md) to download transcripts of your virtual agent chat sessions.
