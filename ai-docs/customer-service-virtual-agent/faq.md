# Frequently asked questions

## General 

### What are the various Browsers supported by the Virtual Agent?

Virtual Agent is supported in the latest versions of Edge, Chrome, and Fire Fox. It is not supported in Internet Explorer.
 
### Can Virtual Agent be styled and branded for an organization? What can be customized and how?

Currently we don't have any styling or brand customization (e.g. changing the default image) for the bot. But this is on the roadmap for a future release.

### Can multiple team members collaborate on a single bot instance?

We donâ€™t have multi author support currently. It is one bot per author. However, we have this feature on the roadmap for future releases. The current mitigation is to create a service account and share it across the content authors.

### Can I do end user authentication using AAD or MSA from within the bot?

We currently do not support any authentication from within the Virtual Agent. However, native support for end user authentication is on the roadmap.

### Virtual Agent Designer does not seem to allow us to store the user utterance that triggered the topic as a variable, is that by design?

Yes, Virtual Agent currently doesn't allow storing the user utterance that triggered the topic as a variable. This feature is on the roadmap for a future release.
