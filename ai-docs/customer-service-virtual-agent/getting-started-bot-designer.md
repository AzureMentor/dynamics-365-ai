# Working with the Bot Designer

The AI for Customer Insights Virtual Agent Bot Designer provides a variety of tools that make it easy to create a powerful custom virtual agent. You can add topics to your bot to help you design a conversation path to resolve customer support issues, and then deploy the bot to a support channel. You can also view analytics information to help you improve the bot and the overall customer experience.

The Bot Designer is composed of several pages designed for different tasks. You can navigate to the different pages by clicking in the navigation pane.
