# Set the scope of how Customer Service Insights generates customer service topics

[!INCLUDE [public-preview](../includes/public-preview.md)]

The artificial intelligence technology that Customer Service Insights uses to group support cases as support topics is fine-tuned and configured to cover the most common support environments and cases. However, the grouping of topics for your customer service system may require a different scope. You may want support cases to be grouped in a more general way, or more specifically.

we also know that different customers have different business needs. The same model configuration doesn’t fit all. One common ask we’ve got from our customers is the flexibility to control the topic granularity. That’s why we introduced the topic granularity settings where you can control the AI model to generate topics with more general or specific scope.

This setting supports five levels of granularity. The illustration in the settings page explains the corresponding topic granularity impact for each level. You can find more information from this how-to article: <TODO: insert documentation link>.
