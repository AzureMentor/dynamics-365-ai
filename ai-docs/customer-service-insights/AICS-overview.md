# Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service Overview

Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service is a set of data analysis tools that use artificial intelligence to help you identify areas for improvement in your customer support system. Whether you are a customer care manager, department head, team manager, business analyst, or system administrator, Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service gives you useful insights into your system's key performance indicators (KPIs).

For example...

The Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service dashboard displays graphs showing key performance indicators and trends related to case volumes, resolution rates, abandonment rates, escalation rates, customer satisfaction, wait times, and a variety of other metrics, highlighting key areas for improvement. You can filter the data displayed on the graphs by time, product, modality, business unit, or team.

Dashboards are populated initially with sample data. When you are ready, you can import your own Dynamics 365 customer service data into Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service to view the key performance indicators and trends in your system.
