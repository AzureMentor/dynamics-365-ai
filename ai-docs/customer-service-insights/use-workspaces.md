# Use workspaces to connect to different customer service environments

[!INCLUDE [public-preview](../includes/public-preview.md)]

When you work with the dashboards in Customer Service Insights, you have a choice of connecting to a live customer service environment or exploring the dashboards using sample data in the demo workspace. You can then create additional workspaces to gain insights into different customer service environments and switch between the workspaces.

## Create an Customer Service Insights workspace

When you first launch Customer Service Insights in your browser, Customer Service Insights opens the **Connect your data** screen so you can create a workspace by connecting to a data source.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Connect your data screen](media/ai-csi-qs-connect-data.png)

Each workspace displays customer service data from a specific customer service data environment. To connect to a Dynamics 365 for Customer Service Insights environment, select **Dynamics 365** to display the **Choose an environment** screen.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Choose an environment screen](media/ai-csi-qs-choose-environment.png)

You can gain insights into multiple sets of customer service data by creating workspaces that each connect to a different environment. For example, you could create different workspaces for environments containing customer support information for specific areas, such as beauty products, retail, or banking.

> ![Multiple environments](media/ai-csi-multiple-environments.png)

To configure the workspace, select the environment you want to use. Customer Service Insights opens the workspace and displays that environment's customer support data in the dashboards.

You can also create a new workspace by:

* Selecting the **Settings** button on the Customer Service Insights title bar and then selecting **Create workspace**.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Create workspace](media/ai-csi-settings-create-workspace.png)

* Selecting the **Settings** button on the Customer Service Insights title bar, selecting **My workspaces**, and then selecting **Create New**.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Create New](media/ai-csi-current-workspaces-create.png)

## Open the demo workspace

By default, Customer Service Insights displays sample customer support data in a demo workspace. To open the demo workspace, select **demo workspace** on the **Connect your data** screen, or close the **Connect your data** screen.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Demo workspace](media/ai-csi-qs-demo-workspace.png)

## Switch between workspaces

Once you have created one or more workspaces, you can easily switch between workspaces, including the demo workspace.

To switch to a different workspace, select the **Workspace** name on the Customer Service Insights title bar. Customer Service Insights opens the **Workspaces** drop-down list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Workspaces list](media/ai-csi-workspaces-list.png)

Select a workspace from the list. Customer Service Insights opens the workspace and displays the customer service data associated with the workspace in the dashboards.

## Delete a workspace

If you no longer want Customer Service Insights to display a workspace in the list of current workspaces, you can delete it.

To delete a workspace, select the **Settings** button on the Customer Service Insights title bar, and then select **My workspaces**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![My workspaces](media/ai-csi-settings-my-workspaces.png)

Customer Service Insights displays the list of current workspaces. Select **Delete** to delete the workspace.
