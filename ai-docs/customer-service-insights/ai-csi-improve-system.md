# Identify areas for improvement in your customer support system

The rich set of dashboards provided by Customer Service Insights not only gives you a detailed picture of your customer service system, it can help you identify key areas for improvement that can increase system performance and customer satisfaction.

The dashboards can help you identify areas for improvement in a variety of ways, including:

* AI Insights charts that group related support cases by topic and show you the impact, both positive and negative, that those cases are having on system performance.
* Charts that give you different views of how long it is taking to resolve support cases, giving you insights on ways to improve resolution time.
* Charts that give you different views of feedback from customers, giving you insights on ways to improve customer satisfaction.
* Charts that give you different views of support agent performance, helping you identify low-performing and high-performing agents.

## Use AI Insights charts to identify support cases that have the most impact on performance

AI Insights charts use language understanding technology to group support cases as topics, helping you identify the types of cases that are having the greatest impact, both positive and negative, on the system.

Many of the AI Insights charts include an Impact field, showing the impact of the support cases associated with the topic as a red or blue bar. A red bar indicates that the topic's impact is negative. A blue bar indicates that the topic's impact is positive. Improving the performance of topics in red will have the greatest impact on improving overall system performance.
