# Trigger a refresh of your Customer Service Insights dashboard data

[!INCLUDE [public-preview](../includes/public-preview.md)]

Customer Service Insights automatically refreshes the data displayed on dashboards daily. You can trigger a refresh on demand without waiting for next daily refresh when you make any of following changes in your workspace:

* Update data mapping settings
* Change case title cleansing settings
* Change topic granularity settings
* Rename a topic

For example, when you rename a topic on the Topics dashboard, Customer Service Insights displays a prompt at the top of the dashboard that gives you an opportunity to refresh your workspace. To refresh the workspace, select **Refresh**.

**Note:** that there is a limit of 10 on-demand refreshes per day per workspace.
