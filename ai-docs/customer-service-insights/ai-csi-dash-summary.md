# KPI Summary dashboard

<img src="media/ai-customer-service-insights.png" width="720">

The KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Summary dashboard gives you a broad overview of the performance of your customer support system. The dashboard uses artificial intelligence technology to give you a graphical view of the system's key performance indicators for a specified time period, including:

* The customer support topics that are generating the most volume.
* The customer support topics that are having the most impact on the system's average resolution time.
* The number of incoming and resolved resolved cases, along with the percent change and trend.
* The number of escalated and SLA (Service Level Agreement) compliant cases, average resolution time and customer satisfaction (CSAT) score, and percent change.
* The breakdown of case priority, backlog and new cases, and case channels.
* The aggregate trend in new and resolved cases.
* The breakdown of unresolved cases by age.

You can narrow down the data displayed on the dashboard to a specific time period, product, channel, business unit, or team by selecting from the filter drop-down boxes at the top of the dashboard.
