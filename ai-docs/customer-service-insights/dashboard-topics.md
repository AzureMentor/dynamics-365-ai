# Topics dashboard

[!INCLUDE [public-preview](../includes/public-preview.md)]

> ![Topics dashboard](media/topics-dash.png)

The Topics dashboard uses artificial intelligence technology to group related support cases as support topics and display them in order of the number of cases associated with each topic. You can then explore the topics and their related support cases, and fine-tune the way cases are grouped into topics. You can:

* Narrow down the list by searching for specific keywords.
* View support cases associated with each topic by selecting a topic in the list.
* Rate the placement of cases in a topic.

## Narrow down the list by searching for specific keywords

You can narrow down the list of topics displayed on the Topics dashboard by searching for a specific keyword in the **Search** box in the upper right corner of the dashboard.

For example, to find topics related to login issues, enter *login* in the **Search** box. Customer Service Insights narrows down the list to topics that include the word *login*.

To restore the original topic list, clear the search box by selecting the close icon.

## View support cases associated with each topic

You can view the support cases associated with a topic by selecting it in the Topics list. For example, to view the support cases associated with the *Password reset link is invalid* topic, select it in the list.
