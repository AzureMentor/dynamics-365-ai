# New cases dashboardâ€‹

The New cases dashboard gives you an overview of the new cases in your customer service system, including using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help you identify emerging issues.

The New cases dashboard includes a variety of charts with graphical views of your system's incoming support cases. For information about each chart, click the link for the chart in the following list, or scroll down to the chart's section below.

* [Case priority](#case-priority-chart)
* [Case channel](#case-channel-chart)
* [Case timing](#case-timing-chart)
* [Current popular topics (AI Insights)](#current-popular-topics-chart)
* [Emerging topics (AI Insights)](#emerging-topics-chart)

The *Current popular topics* and *Emerging topics* charts use natural language understanding artificial intelligence technology to group support cases as *topics* that are a collection of related cases. These charts show you the new customer support topics that are generating the most case volume, and the topics that are showing the biggest change in volume. This can help you identify emerging issues in your system.

By default, the dashboard shows you key performance indicators for the last month, and for all products, channels, business units, and teams in your system. To change the time period, select a value from the Time Period drop-down list at the top of the dashboard. You can select either last day, last week, or last month.

To filter data by product, channel, business unit, or team, select a value from the Product, Channel, Business Unit, or Team drop-down list. For more information on working with filters, see [Work with AI for Customer Service Insights dashboards](use-dashboard-sample-data.md).
