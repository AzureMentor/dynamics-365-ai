# Improve your AI Insights data by cleansing support case titles

AI for Customer Service Insights uses artificial intelligence technology to give you insights into your customer service data by grouping support cases as *topics* that are a collection of related cases. This can help you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on system performance.

The AI Insights charts displayed on the AI for Customer Service Insights dashboards are generated by applying language understanding (AI) technology to the titles of support cases. However, the results can be misleading if the titles include extraneous information such as product name, case status, or ticket number tags. You can improve the quality of the results displayed in AI Insights charts by specifying Data Cleansing settings to disregard tags in titles when they are grouped into topics.

## To cleanse support case titles

1. Click the Settings button on the AI for Customer Service title bar and select **Settings**.

3. Specify any delimiter characters you use to separate tags from each other or from the issue summary, and whether you place tags before or after the summary, or both. Then click **Apply**.

4. Check the results generated by the AI Insights charts, and fine-tune your **Data cleansing** settings as necessary. The settings take effect when you refresh the workspace.
