# Improve your AI Insights data by cleansing support case titles

AI for Customer Service uses artificial intelligence technology to give you insights into your customer support data by grouping support cases as *topics* that are a collection of related cases. This can help you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on system performance.

The AI Insights charts displayed on the AI for Customer Service dashboards are generated by applying artificial intelligence and language understanding technology to the titles of support cases. However, the data can produce unexpected or misleading results if the titles include extraneous information such as product names, case status, or ticket numbers. You can improve the quality of the data by specifying Data Cleansing settings to remove tags from titles before they are grouped into topics.
