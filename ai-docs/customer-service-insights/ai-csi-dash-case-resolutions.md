# Case Resolutions dashboard​

The Case Resolutions dashboard gives you an overview of your customer support system's case resolution performance for the specified time period. The dashboard provides graphical views of resolved cases, including:

* The customer support agents who are taking the most time to resolve issues.
* The number of incoming customer support cases compared to the average time to resolve them.
* The customer support agents with the longest first response time.
* The number of incoming cases compared to the first response time.

In addition, the dashboard uses artificial intelligence technology to categorize customer support cases by topic and show you the topics that are having the greatest impact on resolution time. This can help you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on system performance.

By default, the dashboard shows you key performance indicators for the last week, and for all products, channels, business units, and teams in your system. To change the time period, select a value from the Time Period drop-down list at the top of the dashboard. You can select either last day, last week, or last month. To display data for a specific product, channel, business unit, or team, select a value from the Product, Channel, Business Unit, or Team drop-down list.
