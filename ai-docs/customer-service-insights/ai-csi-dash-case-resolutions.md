# Case Resolutions Dashboard​

The Case Resolutions dashboard gives you an overview of your customer support system's case resolution performance, including:

* The customer support agents who are taking the most time to resolve issues.
* The number of incoming customer support cases compared to the average time to resolve them.
* The customer support agents with the longest first response time.
* The number of incoming cases compared to the first response time.

The dashboard also uses artificial intelligence technology to categorize customer support cases by topic and show you the topics that are having the most impact on the performance of the system.
