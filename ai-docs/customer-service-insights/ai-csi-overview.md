# Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service Insights Overview

Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service Insights gives you actionable insights into critical performance metrics, operational data, and emerging trends from your customer support system. Built-in dashboards, interactive charts, and visual filters provide views into support operations data across channels, and highlight areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact, helping you quickly evaluate and respond to key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer satisfaction levels.

AI for Customer Service Insights uses artificial intelligence technology to enable you to discover and adapt to current and emerging trends, improve brand sentiment, and increase customer loyalty. By using forecasting to pinpoint and fix issues before they impact customers, you can deliver better customer service experiences.

The AI-driven Customer Service Insights technology empowers informed decision making about how to improve resolution rates, reduce wait times, and decrease customer service costs. You can use case resolution insights, backlog trends, and historical comparisons to evaluate agent performance and business impact, and address inefficiencies in your system.
