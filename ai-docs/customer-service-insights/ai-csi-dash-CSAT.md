# Customer Satisfaction dashboard

![Customer Satisfaction dashboard](media/ai-csi-CSAT-dash.png)

The Customer Satisfaction dashboard gives you an overview of customer satisfaction with their support experience during the specified time period. The dashboard provides graphical views of customer satisfaction survey results, including:
 
* The total number of surveys completed.
* The survey response rate.
* The average customer satisfaction (CSAT) score.
* The survey responses by location.

In addition, the dashboard uses artificial intelligence technology to categorize customer support cases by topic and show you the topics that are having the greatest impact on customer satisfaction. This can help you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction.

By default, the dashboard shows you key performance indicators for the last week, and for all products, channels, business units, and teams in your system. To change the time period, select a value from the Time Period drop-down list at the top of the dashboard. You can select either last day, last week, or last month. To display data for a specific product, channel, business unit, or team, select a value from the Product, Channel, Business Unit, or Team drop-down list.
