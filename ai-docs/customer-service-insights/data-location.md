# Where your Customer Service Insights data is stored

Customer Service Insights can be deployed into the Microsoft Azure datacenters (also referred to as “regions”) listed below.

Microsoft may replicate customer data to other regions available within the same geography for data durability, except as specified below. No matter where customer data is stored, Microsoft does not control or limit the locations from which customers or their end users may access customer data.
