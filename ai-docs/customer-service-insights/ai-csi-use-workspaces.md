# Use workspaces to connect to different customer service environments

When you work with the dashboards in AI for Customer Service Insights, you have a choice of connecting to a live customer service environment or exploring the dashboards using sample data in the demo workspace. You can then create additional workspaces to gain insights into difference customer service environments, and switch between the workspaces.

## Create an AI for Customer Service Insights workspace

When you first launch Customer Service Insights in your browser, AI for Customer Service Insights opens the **Connect your data** screen so you can create a workspace by connecting to a data source.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Connect your data screen](media/ai-csi-qs-connect-data.png)

Each workspace displays customer service data from a specific customer service data environment. To connect to a Dynamics 365 for Customer Service environment, click **Dynamics 365** to display the **Choose an environment** screen.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Choose an environment screen](media/ai-csi-qs-choose-environment.png)

You can gain insights into multiple sets of customer service data by creating workspaces that each connect to a different environment. For example, you could create different workspaces for environments containing customer support information for specific areas, such as beauty products, retail, or banking.

> ![Multiple environments](media/ai-csi-multiple-environments.png)

To configure the workspace, select the environment you want to use. AI for Customer Service Insights opens the workspace and displays that environment's customer support data in the dashboards.

You can also create a new workspace by:

* Clicking the **Settings** button on the AI for Customer Service Insights title bar and selecting **Create workspace**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Create workspace](media/ai-csi-settings-create-workspace.png)

* Clicking the **Settings** button on the AI for Customer Service Insights title bar, selecting **My workspaces**, and then selecting **Create New**.

> ![Create New](media/ai-csi-current-workspaces-create.png)

## Open the demo workspace

By default, AI for Customer Service Insights displays sample customer support data in a demo workspace. To open the demo workspace, click **demo workspace** on the **Connect your data** screen, or close the **Connect your data** screen.

> ![Demo workspace](media/ai-csi-qs-demo-workspace.png)

## Switch between workspaces

Once you have created one or more workspaces, you can easily switch between workspaces, including the demo workspace.

To switch to a different workspace, click the **Workspace** name on the AI for Customer Service Insights title bar. AI for Customer Service Insights opens the **Workspaces** drop-down list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Workspaces list](media/ai-csi-workspaces-list.png)

Select a workspace from the list. AI for Customer Service Insights opens the workspace and displays the customer service data associated with the workspace in the dashboards.

## Delete a workspace

If you no longer want AI for Customer Service Insights to display a workspace in the list of current workspaces, you can delete it.

To delete a workspace, click the Settings button on the AI for Customer Service Insights title bar, and select **My workspaces**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![My workspaces](media/ai-csi-settings-my-workspaces.png)

Customer Service Insights displays the list of current workspaces. Click **Delete** to delete the workspace.
