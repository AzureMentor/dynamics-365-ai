# Quickstart - Get immediate insights into your customer service system's performance

[!INCLUDE [public-preview](../includes/public-preview.md)]

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights lets you quickly connect to your existing Dynamics 365 customer service data to gain immediate insights into your system's performance. You can also explore with sample data.

## To connect to your customer service data

1. Navigate to [https://csi.ai.dynamics.com](https://csi.ai.dynamics.com) in your browser to open the Customer Service Insights environment. Customer Service Insights displays the **Connect your data** screen. Customer Service Insights supports Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, and Chrome browsers.

   For more information on working with workspaces, see [Use workspaces to connect to different customer service environments](use-workspaces.md).

3. Click the Dynamics 365 environment that contains the customer service data that you want to use.

   Customer Service Insights configures the workspace to use the environment you selected and displays the environment's customer service data in the KPI Summary dashboard.

You can gain a variety of insights from the Customer Service Insights dashboards. For example, AI Insights charts help you identify support cases that have the most impact on your system.

If you want to explore working with the dashboards using sample data before connecting to live data, use the Customer Service Insights built-in demo workspace. To open the demo workspace, select **demo workspace** on the **Connect your data** screen.
