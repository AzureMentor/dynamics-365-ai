# Work with dashboards and sample data

The dashboards included in AI for Customer Service Insights provide a rich set of analytic tools to help give you a clear picture of the performance of your customer service system, and how to improve it. Whether you connect immediately to your customer service data or spend time exploring the sample environment, you can learn how to gain a variety of insights by becoming familiar with the dashboards.

Some key features of the dashboards include:

* Filters to let you view customer service data for a specific time period, product, support channel, business unit, or team.
* Charts showing basic key performance indicators such as case volume, average resolution time, and customer satisfaction.
* Graphical charts showing trends and breakdowns of cases from a variety of views.
* AI Insights charts that use language understanding artificial intellegence technology to show trends for groups of cases related to specific support topics.
