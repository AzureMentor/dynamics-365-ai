# Quickstart - Get immediate insights into your customer service system's performance

Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service lets you quickly connect to your existing Dynamics 365 customer service data to gain immediate insights into your system's performance. You can also explore with sample data. In future versions, you will be able to connect to data in other customer service systems, such as Salesforce.

## To connect to your customer service data
