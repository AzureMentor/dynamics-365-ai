# Known issues

Sometimes, things don't work as expected. We're sorry for that. Before reporting a bug, please have a look at this list to see if we are already aware of the issue. 

## Market Insights Alerts

- Sometimes, you might see an error message that your alert wasn't saved. Please click "Create alert" again if that happens.
- You may not see any news results in the preview if there wasn't anything recent in the news. We do try to pull older results, but sometimes this is unsuccessful. We are investigating this issue.
- On mobile, keyboard focus can get trapped in one of the "Advanced" boxes (if you use them) during alert creation.
- Layout on landscape mode on mobile phones is not very usable. Please use portrait mode until fixed.
- The footer in the email is being updated to have less content and white space
- During alert creation, if there is no news in the preview, you get 2 error messages
- Error messages do not auto dismiss at the moment. Please dismiss them manually until we fix this issue.
