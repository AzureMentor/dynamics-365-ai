# Known issues

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

Sometimes, things don't work as expected. We're sorry for that. Before reporting a bug, please have a look at this list to see if we are already aware of the issue. 

## Market Insights alerts

- When you close the browser, you are signed out of the Market Insights alerts site
- Signing in to the alerts site sometimes takes a moment so it can take some time for your alerts list to show
- Updating a topic won't update the topic name even though the topic itself is updated
- Signing in with an account that didn't have your first name and last name specified, we will show you as “unknown”
- If you name contains special characters, we don't display them correctly
- News article snippets get truncated on the GMail app on iPhone
- When you forward an email, the icons for the trending topics aren't displayed correctly
- The alert email can have extra spaces next to the keyword in some cases
- Signing in to Market Insights alerts with your Google account and then signing in with a different Google account in the same browser won't work. You can only sign in with the original Google account unless you use InPrivate/Incognito browsing or a different browser.
- Signing in can require that you allow pop-ups from the alerts site, especially on devices running iOS or MacOS. We recommend using a PC or Laptop running Windows to sign in to the alerts site.
