## Public Preview update  (January 30, 2019)

###  AI assisted query builder

To get relevant market insights, it is extremely important to ensure that search rules are set up correctly to provide insights on brands, products, and topics that are very relevant and precise to the userâ€™s needs. Currently, it can be difficult for users to get the configuration of search rules correct on the first run because it typically takes time to refine search rules to the level of precision required. 

As a result, the relevance and cost of generating insights heavily depend on cutting out the noise and getting your search set up right.

Our AI-powered assisted query builder solves this core problem. During the first run experience, you can start typing a search term and will be presented with suggested terms. By providing a highly relevant list of brands, products, and entities to select, the assisted query builder helps to reduce the cognitive load of search setup so that you spend less time setting up searches and more time acting on the insights.

### Announcing search rules for [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts and removal of [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] keyword search

As of December 10, 2018, we will introduce the ability to track your own [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts in [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)]. You will be able to acquire posts and comments on your own [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] business accounts. To use this new functionality, the [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Business Account needs to be linked to the respective [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] page. Users in [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] will need to authenticate or re-authenticate their [!INCLUDE [tn-facebook](../includes/tn-facebook.md)] Acquisition profile and set up [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] Account search rules.

[!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] is retiring keyword searches on December 10, 2018, and users will not be able to create new keyword search rules in [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] for [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)]. Existing keyword search rules containing [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] as a source will continue to exist as is, and the data acquired for these rules is preserved, as long as the rules are not changed. However, no new [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data will be acquired for these rules. If the user changes such a rule, [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] needs to be removed as a source to be able to save the edited search rule. In case you want to preserve your [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data acquired to date, we recommend that you create a separate search rule with the changes and keep the rule with [!INCLUDE [tn-instagram](../includes/tn-instagram.md)] data untouched.
