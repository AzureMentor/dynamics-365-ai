# Assign permissions and user roles
Manage user permissions by assigning user roles for newly licensed users and editing user roles for existing users. Learn how to contact licensed users by email in [!INCLUDE[Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-long.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must be a [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] Administrator to perform these tasks.

## Change a role for a user

> [!TIP]
>  You can use the **Search for users** input field to find licensed users of your [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] solution. Additionally, you can filter for users with a specific role by choosing a role in the **Configuration role** or **Interaction role** drop-down list.  
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  The specified user will receive an email with the updated user roles and permissions.  
> 
>  Bulk editing user roles is limited to newly invited users.  
> 
>  Users that are listed as Delegated Administrator always have Administrator and Manager user roles in [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)]. A lock icon ![lock button](media/lock-icon.png "Lock button") next to the user’s name indicates that you can’t change the permissions.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **User Management**.  
  
2.  Identify the user you want to contact and click the **Email** ![send message button in market insights](media/enevelope-icon.png "Send message button in Market Insights") button in the **Users** list.
