# Data handling for Dynamics 365 Market Insights Alerts

To run and improve the service for Market Insights Alerts, we need to store some user data. This article is directed at users of the Market Insights Alerts service. It outlines which data we gather, why we store it, and how you can request to update, export, or delete your personal data.

## Data storage in Market Insights Alerts

The following data is stored:

- **Profile information** from the initial sign-in to sign you in again and remember your alerts 
    - **Account information** (type of account) you use to sign in to recognize your profile when signing in again
    - **First and last name** to display your name on the alerts page
    - **Email address** to send the alert email to the right recipient
    - **Job title** (when signed in with LinkedIn) to improve the relevance of alerts
- **List of alerts** you created to send an alert email
- **Click-through rate** on news articles you clicked in the email to improve the relevance for alerts
- **Feedback** you provide about the relevance of the news in the alert email
- **Visits** to the Market Insights Alerts website for usage statistics

## Request export, update, or deletion of your data

To get your data exported, updated, or deleted, send us an [email](mailto:micustreqs@microsoft.com) and our team will follow up with you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you request deletion of your data, all data will be removed and can't be restored. Even after signing in with the same profile again, all your alerts and feedback we gathered to refine your alerts will be lost.
> - To change your name in the app, update it on the profile you used to sign in. The app will sync your updated name from the profile directly. If this doesn't work, send us an email and request the change.
