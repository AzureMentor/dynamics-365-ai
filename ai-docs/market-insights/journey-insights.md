# Journey insights

## Overview

Customers navigate their way into a website and out of it in many different ways. Knowing this journey can be insightful for businesses to decide where to invest their digital resources.

**Journey** provides a view that notifies you when there is a significant change of traffic volume (increase, decrease, spike or a sharp drop) to a website you choose.

## Data and frequency

**Journey** will show up one day after an element is added and remains static until a significant change in volume is detected in one or more channels, either incoming traffic to or outgoing traffic from the website of interest.
The data is refreshed on weekly basis and will aggregate the last 13 weeks (91 days).

**Journey** triggers notifications based on two conditions:

- Gradual changes (raise and decline) take place over a period longer than a week (up to 90 days)
- Spiking changes are triggered when the change occurs over a shorter period of time
