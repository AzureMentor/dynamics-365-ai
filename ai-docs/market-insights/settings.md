# Manage your settings

The settings page in Dynamics 365 Market Insights consists of two sections: the Account section and the Notifications section. 

To find your settings, open the left navigation and select **Settings**. 

## Configure your notifications

### Receive notifications

You can choose if you want to receive a summary email with your insights on a daily or weekly basis. 

1. In the left navigation select **Settings**.
2. In the **Notification** section, select **Send insights summary to <email address>**.
3. Under **Email frequency**, choose how often and when you want to receive the summary email. 
4. Select **Save** to apply your changes. 

### Stop receiving notifications

1. In the left navigation select **Settings**.
2. In the **Notification** section, select **Do not send me an insights summary**.
3. Select **Save** to apply your changes. 

## Manage your account 

When you sign in to Market Insights, your account is created. You can delete it if you don't want to use Market Insights anymore. 

### Delete your account

Deleting your account can't be undone and will revoke access to all insights data and universe settings immediately. You can sign up for Market Insights with the same email address again but your settings won't be restored.

1. In the left navigation select **Settings**.
2. In the **Account** section, select **Delete Market Insights account**.
3. In the dialog box, confirm the deletion.
