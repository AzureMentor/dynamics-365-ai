# Community insight

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

## Overview

Identifying online spaces where own or competitor's business is being discussed can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Nonetheless this knowledge is crucial in order to stay up-to-date or to interact in these discussions.  

## Top Communities

**Top Communities** identifies up to five online communities that are most relevant related to an element configured in the universe.  


## Data and frequency

**Top Communities** will show after finishing the initial setup if at least one community was detected. Generally, the insight is recalculated every week and surfaced in the feed. If there are significant changes (e.g. a new community was detected and is in the top communities for the first time), the insight will show in the feed as well. 

**Top Communities** aggregate various data from web (such as number of visitors) around a selected element and calculate a relevance score for every community.
