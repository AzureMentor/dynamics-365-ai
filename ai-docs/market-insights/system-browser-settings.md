# Optimize browser settings for [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)]

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

In our everyday lives, we use our favorite browsers to work with web applications and surf the Internet.  Some browser settings can impact the user experience for a few features in [!INCLUDE[Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-long.md)]. This topic discusses recommended browser settings for a smooth experience.

## Manage pop-up blockers  
 To link posts to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)], add social profiles, engage on social posts, and create certain types of search rules, your browser needs to open new windows automatically. This may trigger your browser’s pop-up blocker.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  We recommend that you add the URL of your [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] solution to the list of trusted sites and allow pop-ups.  
  
 Many browsers allow you to choose how new tabs or pages open by default when a pop-up is encountered. Some of the features may not work if your browser is set to open pop-ups in a new tab.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  We recommend that you configure your browser to open pop-ups in a new window.

## Work InPrivate or go incognito  
 You can often avoid issues with session cookies by using your preferred browser in “private mode”. This lets you establish a fresh session to the sites and application you log on to without interfering with cookies from other sessions.
