# Takeover an unamanged Market Insights tenant

When a self-service user signs up for the Market Insights Preview, they are added to an unmanaged Azure AD directory based on their email domain. If a domain admin decides to take over the unmanaged tenant as part of their managed tenant, they can perform an admin takeover. 

For detailed information, see [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/domains-admin-takeover).

User data and acquired posts are merged depending on the existance of a Market Insights subscription as outlined in the sections below.
