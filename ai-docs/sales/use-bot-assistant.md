The bot for Dynamics 365 assistant app for Microsoft Teams allows you to search Dynamics 365 apps records within Microsoft Teams conversations. 

When you use the bot for the first time, you must configure it by selecting the environment and signing in. After the first configuration, you can use the bot without any configurations. To learn more, see [Configure Dynamics 365 assistant bot](configure-dynamics-365-bot.md).

Open the Dynamics 365 assistant app on your mobile device and select the bot icon. A conversation page will open, and you can type questions in the search field to find related answers.

For example, you can enter **Contoso** in the search field and press Enter.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Search using bot](media/si-teams-app-bot-search.png "Search using bot")

The result will display top matches for Contoso, such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and leads. Select a result and you can get further details.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Results of the search](media/si-teams-app-bot-search-results.png "Results of the search")
