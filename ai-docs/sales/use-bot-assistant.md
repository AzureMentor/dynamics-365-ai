# Get answers through bot assistant

The bot for Dynamics 365 assistant app for Teams feature allows you to search Dynamics 365 apps records within Microsoft Teams conversations. 

When you are using the bot for the first time, you must configure the bot by selecting the environment and signing in. After the first configuration, you can start using the bot without any configurations. To learn more, see [Configure Dynamics 365 bot](configure-dynamics-365-bot.md).

Open the Dynamics 365 assistant app on mobile and select the bot icon. A conversation page opens, and you can start typing questions in the search field to find related answers.

For example, if you enter **Contoso** in the search field and press enter, the result will display top matches for **Contoso** such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and leads. Select a result, and you can further go into the details of the result.
