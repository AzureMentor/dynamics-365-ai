# Preview feature: Analyze customer calls to improve sales

Applies to Dynamics 365 (online), version 9.1.0

<!--from editor: Changed the first sentence to "Sales calls are an important part ..." instead of "the most important part," because that might not be the case for every business customer.-->

Sales calls are an important part of your business. They help you grow your business by improving sales and generating revenue. [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-ai-sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] provides you with **Call intelligence**, an intelligent solution to analyze these calls. Analyzing the data from Call intelligence helps you to:

- Increase sales wins.
- Reduce new salesperson ramp-up time. 
- Increase productivity gains for the business.

As a sales manager, you can open the **Call intelligence** feature to view the overall team performance and the individual performances of sales reps. This helps you to:

- Assess overall customer sentiments and sentiment trends. 
- Identify keywords that customers use most during calls.
- Identify competitor names that customers bring up during calls.
- Assess your team's contributions toward customer sentiment.
- Gain insight into what’s going on with your team.
- Identify potential sales reps who might need coaching.
- Drill down into the sales rep view and analyze the data such as conversational KPIs, insights, and customer sentiment of sales reps.
- Analyze call transcripts and identify the areas where sales reps need coaching.
