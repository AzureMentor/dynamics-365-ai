-	You must have an administrator or similar role.

-	You must have a Dynamics 365 Sales organization. 

-	You must purchase a [Dynamics 365 Sales Insights](https://portal.office.com/Signup/MainSignUp.aspx?OfferId=5be85c9f-df71-4bcf-ac2f-b2a05b4a1f99) license. 

-	You must get access to the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights application. If you do not have access, follow these steps:
    
    1.	To access the app, go to [sales.ai.dynamics.com](https://sales.ai.dynamics.com/).
    
    2.	Enter your work email address.
    
    3.	When the application recognizes the email, you must sign in using Azure Active Directory. To learn more, see [Azure AD Connect user sign-in options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-connect-user-signin).

-	You must create a v2 storage account with an Azure subscription to create blob container to configure call data. To learn more, see [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=portal#create-a-storage-account-1).
