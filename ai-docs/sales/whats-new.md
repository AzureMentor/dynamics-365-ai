<!--from editor: The "more information" titles vary somewhat from the actual titles that they link to, especially the one in Relationship analytics. I think it helps the reader know they've gone to the right place if the titles match or nearly match.-->


### For sales reps

- **Relationship analytics**: Relationship analytics empowers salespeople by providing a view into the health of a sales deal in the opportunity pipeline by combining the engagement data from Dynamics 365, Exchange Online, and LinkedIn InMail. This helps sales reps to understand the relationship health and trend, and evaluate where to invest their time. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [View customer activity history](../sales/relationship-analytics.md)

- **Predictive lead scoring**: Predictive lead scoring provides scores for leads based on key variables of your leads. This helps the sales reps to prioritize their efforts and focus on leads that are more likely to convert into opportunities. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Prioritize leads using predictive scores](../sales/work-predictive-lead-scoring.md)

- **Predictive opportunity scoring**: Predictive opportunity scoring provides scores for opportunities based on key variables of your opportunities. This helps the sales reps to focus their efforts on opportunities that are more likely to convert into deals. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Prioritize opportunities using predictive scores](../sales/work-predictive-opportunity-scoring.md)

- **Notes analysis**: Notes analysis looks at your notes and posts on your timeline wall and suggests actions that you can take. The suggestions include creating a task and appointment. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [How notes analysis assists you with suggestions](../sales/notes-analysis.md)

- **Talking points**: Salespeople interact with many customers over time and it can be difficult to remember every detail about these customers. Talking points intelligently picks up key past email communications about topics such as sports, health, family, and entertainment to help sales reps start a new conversation with customers they haven't spoken with recently or have never met face to face. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Know conversation starters for your customers](../sales/talking-points.md)

- **Who knows whom**: With Who knows whom, salespeople can easily identify colleagues within their organization who can introduce them to leads or contacts. These introductions increase sales performance to improve lead-to-opportunity conversion rates and help close more deals. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Get introduced to a lead](../sales/who-knows-whom.md)

### For sales managers (Preview)

- **[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app**: The [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app proactively and prescriptively provides useful insights from sales data. This helps sales managers to evaluate and improve the performance of their sales teams on [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. With measurement and pipeline forecasting using relationship health scores, sales managers can better optimize their sales strategies.

- **Call intelligence**: Call intelligence is part of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)]. Call intelligence enables smarter coaching to boost sales conversion rates by analyzing call statistics on sentiments, keyword mentions, and KPIs. By connecting call center telephony recording systems to the app, call center managers can generate conversation insights to make better sales decisions. [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] and non-Dynamics organizations can use the Microsoft call intelligence to generate conversation insights to make sales decisions that contribute to the growth of your business.
