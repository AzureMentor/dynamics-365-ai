By default, when you access the Dynamics 365 assistant app for Teams on mobile, the app assigns the recent organization that you are associated with. If you are associated with multiple organizations, the Dynamics 365 for Teams app provides an option to choose an organization from the list of organizations. This helps you to keep up to date with different organization that you are associated with.

To change an organization, follow these steps:

1.	Open Microsoft Teams mobile app and then go to the Dynamics 365 app.

2.	On the home page, select settings icon.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select settings icon](media/si-teams-app-select-settings.png "Select settings icon") 

    The organization that the app currently uses is displayed.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Current organization](media/si-teams-app-current-organization.png "Current organization") 

3.	Select the organization and a list of organizations that are associated with you are displayed.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of available organizations](media/si-teams-app-list-of-organizations.png "List of available organizations") 

4.	Select the organization that you want to change and select **Continue**.

    Your organization is changes to the selected and you can start using application.
