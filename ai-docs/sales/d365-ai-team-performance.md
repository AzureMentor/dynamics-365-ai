# Preview: Analyze team performance

Applies to Dynamics 365 (online), version 9.1.0 <br>

As a sales manager, you must help every sales rep to win deals and generate revenue more effectively. There will be few sales reps who can outperform other sales reps in your team to reach the quota. The **Teams** section provides information on how the team is attaining their objectives. You can analyze the data and coach everyone to win deals and generate revenue. 

On [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app, select **Teams**. The **Teams** section displays as follows and contains the following two tabs:
- Using the **Leaderboard** tab, you can see individual performance side by side, making it easy to compare which sales rep is doing good and which sales rep needs training.
- Using the **Scorecards** tab, you can see reports that allow you to get a 360-degree view of each sales rep.

## Leaderboard

The **Leaderboard** tab provides you with information on the performances of sales reps’ side by side and compare who is doing better and who needs assistance. These comparations are done through KPIs and time period. This tab helps you to answer some basic questions such as:

- How are your sales reps performing?
- Who is been struggling to win bid opportunities?
- Who is been struggling to respond and qualify lead?

The following is an example of how **Leaderboard** tab displays:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Leaderboard tab view](media/d365-ai-team-leaderboard.png "Leaderboard tab view")

You can filter the data based on the KPIs and time period to focus on the performance of sales reps. For example, Bert Hair is a sales rep. You want to see the actual revenue of Bert Hair in the current sales cycle and focus on his performance. Select the KPI as **Actual revenue** and time period as **Current period** and then select Bert Hair information on any report and the information related to him is highlighted as shown below:

### KPI Measures

The KPI measures are used to measure values of the sales team to track and determine their progress on achieving the sales targets.

The information is filtered and displayed on forecast, actuals, pipeline, and leads sections.

> ![Forecast section view](media/d365-ai-team-scorecard-forecast.png "Forecast section view")

1. **Quota:** Displays the total goal that the selected sales rep needs to achieve in the selected time period.
2. **Projected revenue:** Displays the revenue that the sales rep can achieve in the selected time period. This revenue is the sum of actual revenue generated (Closed Won) till date and the revenue that is available in the pipeline (Projected to Close) to be closed in the current time period.
3. **Progress:** Displays the progress on how the sales rep is achieving his quota. The information is displayed on the basic area chart where the x-axis represents the time period and the y-axis represents the revenue. The vertical bar specifies the current time. Hovering over a line displays more information. Highlighting a line in the graph cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page... and vice versa.
You can compare the quota (Red) with how the sales rep is reaching target against the best case (Blue), projected (Yellow), and worst case (Purple).
4. **Revenue pipeline:** Displays the total open revenue available in the pipeline of the sales rep and with how much revenue the sales rep could exceed the quota.

For example, for the current time period, Bert Hair has a revenue quota of $100,000 to achieve in the current sales cycle. By looking at the projected revenue, you can see that he could exceed the quota by 832% with $832,000. Also, you can see how he’s trending towards the quota and what is in his pipeline.

## Actuals

The **Actuals** section helps you to understand the actual revenue generated by a sales rep in the specified time period. This section is classified into five sub-sections:
