# First-run set up experience of Sales Insight application

When you sign into the Sales Insights application, the application will be available for you to use and explore the various features through the provided demo data. However, you must set up Dynamics 365 environment, grand app permissions, connect call data, and enable preview to use the features that the application offers.
After you sign in, you can set up the application depending on the role that is assigned to you.

-	As an administrator, you can set up the complete application including connecting the call data, grant permissions to create app users, and enable preview. To learn more, see [Administrator setting up application](#administrator-setting-up-application).

-	As a sales manager or seller, you can set up application only by connecting your Dynamics 365 environment to gather data to display on KPIs. To learn more, see [Manager or seller setting up application](#manager-or-seller-setting-up-application).

The following diagram illustrates the process of setting up application through different user roles:
