# Scan business cards and meeting notes

The Dynamics 365 assistant app provides an integrated scan option that allows you to quickly create or add notes, contacts, and tasks. For example, when you complete a meeting with a potential customer, using the scan option, you can scan the business card to create contact and handwritten notes to generate tasks and notes in Dynamics 365 Sales.

The following options are provided in the app to scan:

-	[Scan business cards](#scan-business-cards)

-	[Scan meeting notes](#scan-meeting-notes)
