# Configure keywords and competitors to track

You should configure keywords and competitor that you would like to track in the calls and are relevant to you and your organization. Whenever the defined keywords or competitors are mentioned in a call, conversation intelligence will gather the data and display it appropriately on the dashboard.

Using **Conversation content** section, you can add or remove keywords and competitors to track in the calls. Follow these steps:

1.	Review the perquisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to setup Sales Insights application](prereq-sales-insights-app.md).

2.	Open **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights** application. 

3.	Select the **Settings** icon on the top-right of the page and then select **Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select settings option](media/si-app-admin-select-settings.png "Select settings option")

4.	On the **Settings** page, select **Conversation content**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Conversations section](media/si-app-admin-select-conversation-content.png "Conversations section")

5.	On the **Tracked keywords** section, enter a keyword in the **Add a keyword** and press **Enter**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Tracked keywords section](media/si-app-admin-enter-tracked-keywords.png "Tracked keywords section")

6.	Repeat **step 5** to add other keywords.

7.	On the **Competitors** section, enter a competitor name in the **Add a competitors** and press **Enter**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Competitors section](media/si-app-admin-enter-competitors.png "Competitors section")
