# Introduction to administer Sales Insights application

The **Sales Insights** application assists the sales managers and sellers in your organization to get an overview of the conversation with customers. The **Sales Insights** application helps:

-	Sales managers drill down to get call statistics for individual sellers, such as customer sentiment, keywords used, and competitors mentioned in the conversation. Sales managers can use this data to give smarter coaching to sellers and improve the business.

-	Sellers analyze their conversation data and identify improvements in the conversation style to enhance sales and generate revenue.

As an administrator, when you sign-in to the application for the first time, you can set up the application. After you complete the setup, sales managers and sellers in your organization can sign-in and use the application seamlessly. To learn more, see [First-run set up experience of Sales Insight application](fre-setup-sales-insight-app.md).

You can also update each setting later as required. The following are the available configurations:

-	Connect your Dynamics 365 environment to gather data and display on KPIs. To learn more, see [Connect to Dynamics 365 for Sales environment](connect-dynamics365-sales-environment.md).

-	Connect to call data repository. To learn more, see [Configure conversation intelligence to connect call data](configure-conversation-intelligence-call-data.md).

-	Define keywords and competitors that will be tracked in conversations. To learn more, see [Configure keywords and competitors to track](configure-keywords-competitors.md).

-	Define how long you want to retain the data in the application and remove seller specific data. To learn more, see [Data retention and deletion through Privacy](data-retention-deletion-policy.md).

-	Enable preview features. To learn more, see [Enable preview features](enable-preview-features-sales-insights-app.md).
