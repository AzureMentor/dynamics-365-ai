# Preview: Unlock sales potential with Dynamics 365 AI for sales

Applies to Dynamics 365 (online), version 9.1.0 <br>

As a sales manager, you must lead your business to success not only by selling products but also helping your sales team to win deals to generate revenue. You must ensure that each sales rep is onboarded, well informed, supported, and motived. [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] provides solutions which use analytics and data science to gather data from [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] and Microsoft Office, and provide information and insights to intelligently manage your team, proactively coach sales reps, and quickly answer questions regarding the business. To achieve this, [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app provides you with information through key performances indicators (KPIs) for pipeline and deals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app is currently available only in the North America region.

In this section, we describe:
- Recommendation to use [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app
- How to get the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app
- How to access [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app

## Recommendation to use [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app

Before you start using the application, we recommend you review the following requirements to effectively use the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app:
-	Verify that you have subscription to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales.
- Verify that fiscal year period is configured for your organization. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Work with fiscal year settings](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/work-fiscal-year-settings)
- Verify that proper manager hierarchy is defined for you, and sales reps or individuals are added to it. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manager hierarchy and Position hierarchy security models](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/hierarchy-security#manager-hierarchy-and-position-hierarchy-security-models)
- Verify that goals are defined for sales reps or individuals in your hierarchy and when goals are created, ensure that the value for **Goal Metric** is configured as **Revenue**.  [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create or edit a goal (Sales and Sales Hub)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/sales-enterprise/create-edit-goal-sales)
- Verify that Relationship assistant is enabled to access the cards. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Use relationship assistant to guide customer communications](../sales/relationship-assistant.md)

## How to get [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app

[!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_ai_sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] app is a stand-alone application and you must log in to the application to use it. You can use one of the following entry points to access the application:
- Go to [Dynamics 365 AI for Sales](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/sales/) marketing page and select **GET IT NOW**.
- Go to [sales.ai.dynamics.com](https://sales.ai.dynamics.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> You must purchase **[!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-ai-sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)]** license to use AI sales features. 
 
## How to access Dynamics 365 AI for Sales app

You must log in to the application to view the KPIs for pipeline and deals. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Five users can log in and use the application for an organization. If more users want to use the application, a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] system administrator must log in to the application.

Letâ€™s look at an example, Kevin is a sales manager and when he logs in to the application for the first time, the application prompts him to select his [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] organization. This helps to compute and consolidate the necessary insights about the team for Kevin on home page. If he has already logged in and using the application, he can directly access the home page. 

> [!NOTE]
> When you log in for the first time, the application takes several minutes to gather the data and display visuals for you. Also, a status message is displayed to update you on progress.

The following diagram illustrates how you can access the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-ai-sales](../includes/pn-dynamics-ai-sales.md)] application.
