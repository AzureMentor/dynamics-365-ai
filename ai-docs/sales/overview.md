## Free Sales Insights features 

These Sales Insights features are available for free with Dynamics 365 Sales: 

- **Assistant (free)**: The assistant (formerly known as Relationship assistant) combines and analyzes the information that is at its disposal from Dynamics 365 Sales, and then generates a collection of action cards that are displayed as your entry point to Dynamics 365 Sales on mobile devices, and as a carousel or column display on your web-based dashboards. To learn more, see  [Use assistant to guide customer communications](assistant.md). 

- **Auto capture (free)**: The auto capture analyzes your email messages directly in Microsoft Exchange to find all messages that might be relevant to your work in sales. The application looks for messages to or from relevant email addresses and presents you with the relevant messages right in Sales. To learn more, see [Auto capture of related emails](auto-capture.md). 

- **Email engagement (free)**: The email engagement helps you create more effective email messagesâ€”and learn how your contacts are interacting with them. Stay on top of your email and prioritize those prospects or customers that are most engaged. To learn more, see [Use email engagement to view message interactions](email-engagement.md). 


## Advanced Sales Insights features
