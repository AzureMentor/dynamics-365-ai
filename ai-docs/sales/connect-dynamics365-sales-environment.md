# Connect to Dynamics 365 environment

The **Data sources** section helps you to disconnect or connect a Dynamics 365 for Sales environment with your Sales Insights application. If you have multiple environments in your organization and want to activate another environment to display data in application, use this section. 

At a time, you can have only one active Dynamics 365 environment that is connected to the application. When you activate an environment, the existing environment will automatically deactivates, and the new environmentâ€™s data will be displayed on the application. Also, you must add tracked keywords, competitors, and provide permission to access the data to the added environment.

As an administrator you must configure the Dynamics 365 for Sales environment to connect to the Sales Insights application.

1.	Review the perquisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to setup Sales Insights application](prereq-sales-insights-app.md).

2.	Open **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights** application. 

3.	Select the **Settings** icon on the top-right of the page and then select **Settings**.

    > ![Select settings option](media/si-app-admin-select-settings.png "Select settings option")

4.	On the **Settings** page, select **Data source**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Data source section](media/si-app-admin-select-data-source.png "Data source section")
 
5.	On the **Dynamics 365 environment** section, select **+ Add an environment**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select an environment to add](media/si-app-admin-select-add-an-environment.png "Select an environment to add")
 
6.	On the **Connect your data** dialog box, select your Dynamics 365 for Sales environment to connect with the application.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Dynamics 365 for Sales environment](media/si-app-admin-connect-d365-organization.png "Select Dynamics 365 for Sales environment")

    The application detects your environment.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Accept terms and conditions](media/si-app-admin-accept-tandc.png "Accept terms and conditions")

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have already added this environment, this step to grant permissions for application to access the data will be skipped.

9.	On the **Connect your call data** dialog box, enter the **Storage connection string** and **Container name** and select **Connect**. To learn more on how to get the **Storage connection string** and **Container name** values, see [Configure conversation intelligence to connect call data](configure-conversation-intelligence-call-data.md).

10.	On the **Keyword and competitor tracking** dialog box, add the keywords and competitors that you want to track on the call. You can update these keywords and trackers later when your organization requires a change. To learn more, see [Configure keywords and competitors in Conversation content](configure-keywords-competitors.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also skip adding the keywords and competitors and add them later when required.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add tracked keywords and competitors](media/si-app-admin-keywords-and-competitor-tracking.png "Add tracked keywords and competitors")
 
11.	Select **Finish** to complete the set-up of Sales Insights application for your organization.

Now, your Sales Insights application is ready with the data of the added environment.
