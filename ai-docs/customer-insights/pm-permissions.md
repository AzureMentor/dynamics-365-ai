# Permissions

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The main administration page is the **Permissions** page where you can set up roles and permissions for using Customer 360 across your organization.

In this screen you can view **organization members** as well as **groups** for whom **roles** and **permissions** where assigned:
- A permission is represented by a blue box on the right side of the record: Checked box means that this person or group has permission and vice versa 
- A role is specified under the *Rules* column
- The *Type* column specifies whether it's a single member or a group
- Lastly, you can sort the results by each of the columns by clicking on the arrow icon next to the column name:

- **Adding Roles and Permissions** 
In terms of roles, it's possible to define organization members as either ***Administrators***, ***Contributors*** or ***Readers***. This definition process is done via the **Add Permissions** panel that can be accessed via  **Add** at the top of the permissions page:

- **Viewing current number of users per role:** This can be done via the **Roles** panel that can be accessed via **Roles** at the top of the permissions page:

(add permissions page with opened "roles" panel from the administration part on the app)

- **Filtering Permissions by a Role**: This can be achieved by opening the **Filter** panel through **Filter** at the top of the permissions page, and choosing whether to filter the permissions by the ***Administrator***, ***Contributor*** or ***Reader*** roles.
