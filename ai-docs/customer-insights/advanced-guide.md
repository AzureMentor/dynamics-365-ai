> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature currently has limited availability.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]  
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_expect_changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]

## How to use the Advanced Guide
All product sections are accessed through their corresponding tab names in the left-side menu of the app as shown below:

//Replace the image below with image 1 in the 10/15 list:
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-dashboard-full.png "Customer dashboard")

In order to best utilize this guide for your specific needs, you should identify your situation:
- ***I am new to the product -> In that case you may want to explore the guide from start to end. As shown below, product sections are represented by tabs on the left-side menu. This guide's flow reflects the order by which you should work with the product: **Completing the *Data Manager* and *Configure Data* sections and only then exploring the *Segments and Customer 360 Dashboard* sections**.  
- ***I am already using the product but incurring a specific issue*** -> In that case you may want to identify what product section this issue relates to and explore this particular section.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

Select **More categories** to choose from more industries and business functions:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## Bring in your data
Once you've selected a business category you will get to the *Data Manager* main screen where you should first choose ***Get Data*** as shown below.   

//Replace the image below with image 4 in the 10/15 list:
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/choose-data-source75.png "Choose a data source")
