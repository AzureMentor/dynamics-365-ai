# Profiles

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

// replace 1
The **Profiles** page presents consolidated data on each of your customers. Each customer profile is represented by a **Customer Card** tile as shown below.

In order to view more customers profiles, move to the next profiles page using the button shown below in red:

// add 1

**Note**: The data that is available in this page is based on the unified Customer Profile entity you have created during the data configuration process. If you didnâ€™t complete the data configuration process yet, your customer profile tiles might present only partial information on your customers:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile.png "Customer Card tiles")

Make sure to complete the **Data Configuration** process in order to unlock richer view on your customers (visit the **Configure Data** section to learn more).

After selecting a customer tile, you will see additional information on that specific customer. As shown below, that information may include attributes such as **Country**, **Email**, **Address**, and **Phone** that exist in one or more of your data sources.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile-customer-info.png "Customer Card tile customer info")

You can also create custom attributes using the **Measures** page. The following example is the customer **Churn Score** information marked in red below.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile-customer-churn-score.png "Customer Card tile churn score")

## Search for customers

Searching for customers can be done using the **Search** field. Simply type one of the attributes' names to search for customers. This is enabled by the administrator in the **Search, sort & filter** page. Note that the search will be executed only within the Customer Profile entity created during the data configuration process.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile-search.png "Customer Card tile search")

You can also utilize this capability to search for a specific type of information (specific attribute) for a given customer.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile-search2.png "Customer Card tile search")

## Filter customers

Filtering customers can be done via a menu that includes your Customer Profile entity fields as filters. 

First, select **Filter**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile-filter.png "Customer Card tile filter")

Then, simply check the boxes next to the filters with which to search customers by as shown below. Same as for the **Search** field, you will be able to filter only by attributes that exist in your Customer Profile entity and that were defined by the administrator in the **Search, sort & filter** page.

// add 2

You can remove your saved filters using **Clear filters**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![](media/customer-card-tile-clear-filter.png "Customer Card tile clear filter")
