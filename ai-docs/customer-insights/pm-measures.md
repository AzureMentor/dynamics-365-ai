[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Measures screen** enables you to define all the KPIs that best reflect your specific business domain and goals.                     Once defined, you can benefit from your measures in a verity of ways. For example:

- View for a specific customer as part of the **Customer Card** (visit the *Customer Card Section* to learn more) 
- Use to define your segment by, using the Segment Builder Screen

### Choosing between Three Measure Types
There are two early decisions you should make with regard to your desired measure. These decisions will help you choose between the three options that are available to you when you click the **New Measure** button:

- First, you should decide whether to:
  - Save your measure as an attribute within one of your existing entities - than you should choose the **Profile Attribute** option 
  - Or create a new entitiy around your measure 
- 2.If decided to save the measure as an entity, you should also decide whether to:
  - Create the measure on the basis of field/s from the Customer Profile entity - which corresponds to the **Profile Measure** option
  - Or create it on the basis of another ingested entity - which corresponds to the **Business Measure**

In the next three sub-sections we will explore the steps you should complete in order to define your measure.
