## Measures

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Measures screen** enables you to define all the KPIs that best reflect your specific business domain and goals.                     Once defined, you can benefit from your measures in a verity of ways. For example:
- Consume on your Homepage (Dashboard) Screen 
- View for a specific customer as part of the **Customer Card** (visit the *Customer Card Section* to learn more) 
- Use to define your segment by, using the Segment Builder Screen

### Step1: Choosing between Three Measure Types
There are two early decisions you should make with regard to your desired measure. These decisions will help you choose between the three options that are available to you when you click the **New Measure** button:

// 1

// 2

- First, you should decide whether you wish to:
  - Save your measure as an attribute within one of your existing entities - than you should choose the **Profile Attribute** option 
  - Or create a new entitiy around your measure 
- 2.If decided to save the measure as an entity, you should also decide whether to:
  - Create the measure on the basis of field/s from the Customer Profile entity - which corresponds to the **Profile Measure** option
  - Or create it on the basis of another ingested entity - which corresponds to the **Business Measure**

In the next three sub-sections we will explore the steps you should complete in order to define your measure. 

### Step2: Choosing the Base Entity
Upon choosing one of the options, you can expect to reach the **Measure Creation Panel**.

**Panel you can expect to see upon selecting the *Profile Attribute* option**:

**Name** (mandatory): Upon completing the configuration of your measure, it will show up in the Measures screen as a saved measure that you can edit. Within the measures screen, your saved measure will carry the name you define under the **Name** field in this panel.
**Display Name** (optional): As mentioned earlier, your measure will also be added as an attribute or be saved a new entity. In both cases, the measure will carry the name you define under the **Display Name** field in this panel.
**Starting Entity** (mandatory): Here you should choose the entity on the basis of which you wish to construct your measure. If you wish to include in your measure fields from multiple entities, choose at this point one of those entities.
