# Enrich Profiles

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Through it's **Configure Data** process, Customer 360 enables you, the user, to consolidate data around your customers from all of your sources. At the same time, Customer 360 goes beyond that and put at your fingertips additional ML-produced knowledge about your customers that comes from propriatery data. This section covers the **Enrich Profiles** screen that can be used to **unlock data on the affinity of your customers to hundreds of brands and dozens of interest-categories** (which might be *Home Appliances*, *Shoes* or *Financial loans* as an example).

Note: The *Enrich Profiles* screen can be accessed both through the app left-side menu and from the *Configure Data* screen as shown:

As shown above, this screen includes two major sections:
- The **Demographics** section, where you should make selections for at least two fields among **Date of Birth**, **Gender** and **Zip Code**. The intent behind these selections is to focus on the customers for which you wish to gain knowledge around preferred brands and interests. 
- The **Brands and Categories** section, where you can take one of two approaches:
  - 1.**Choose on my own**: This option allows you to choose brands and interest-categories that are of most interest to you and get your customers' affinities for those selections
  - 2. **Industry's top brands and categories**: Get the brands and interests which all of your customers, taken together, have the highest affinities with. Note that in *Customers* we refer only to the customers you chose on the *Demographics* section.
