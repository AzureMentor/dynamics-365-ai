# Admin

The Customer Insights administration pages include the **Permissions** and **Settings** pages. You can access both from the app's left-side menu.

**If you are an administrator:**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to give other users across the organization access to Customer Insights. There are two types of access: **Reader** and **Writer**. See how they differ by visiting the [**Permissions** section](pm-permissions.md).
- You can use the **Settings** page to give easily identifiable names to your instances. You can also specify a name for your organization and define its region.

**If you are not an administrator:**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to learn what is accessible to you as a user. As explained in the [**Permissions** section](pm-permissions.md), what you can access  depends on whether you have **Writer** or **Reader** permissions.
