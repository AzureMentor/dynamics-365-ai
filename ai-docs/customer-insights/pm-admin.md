# Admin

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Customer Insights administration pages include the **Permissions** page and the **Settings** page. Both pages are accessible via the left app menu as shown below:

How can you best utilize the Admin pages? That depends on your role.

**If you are an administrator**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to give access to Customer Insights to other users across the organization. There are two types of access: a **Reader** and a **Writer**. You can learn how they differ by visiting the **Permissions** section. 
- You can also use the **Settings** page to give easily-identifiable names to your instances. Within this page you can also specify a name for your organization and define for it a region. 

**If you are not an administrator**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to learn what is accessible to you as a user in Customer Insights. As explained in the **Permissions** section, it depends whether you have the permission of a **Writer** or of a **Reader**.
- You should not use the **Settings** page.
