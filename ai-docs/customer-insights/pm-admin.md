[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Customer Insights administration pages include the **Permissions** and **Settings** pages. You can access both from the app's left-side menu.

**If you are an administrator:**
<!--note from editor: add links to cross-refs: Line 29, Line 34-->

- You can use the **Permissions** page to give other users across the organization access to Customer Insights. There are two types of access: **Reader** and **Writer**. You can learn how they differ by visiting the **Permissions** section. 
- You can use the **Settings** page to give easily identifiable names to your instances. You can also specify a name for your organization and define a region for it. 

**If you are not an administrator:**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to learn what is accessible to you as a user. As explained in the **Permissions** section, what you have access to depends on whether you have **Writer** or **Reader** permissions.
