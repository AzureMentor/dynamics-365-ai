# Home

The first page you see in the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights app is **Home**. The Home page gives you a holistic view of your customer base and metrics to track the health of your business.

## Change between environments

You can switch from a demo environment to your live environments if you want to work with data of your customers, given they've already been [set up and configured](pm-data-sources.md). Select the **Environment** control in the upper-right corner of the page to change environments.

## Explore the home page

To access these insights on the home page, take a few steps to onboard, unite, and enrich your data. 

Through the data manager and unify processes, you can create a unified dataset of your customers out of datasets that are currently siloed and disconnected. Then you can use capabilities such as *Measures*, *Enrichment*, and *Activities* to unlock richer insights. Use capabilities such as *Segments* and *Customer Card* to act on the new insights.

The types of insights you can expect to view on the home page are shown here.

Let's explore those insights:

- **Aggregate-level insights** (#1): Tiles with business insights (from the measures you define on the **Measures** page). Only Business measures will show up here. Can include predictive key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average likelihood of customer churn.
- **Information on preferred brands and interests within your customer base** (#2): This unique information can be unlocked via the **Enrich Profiles** page after completing the *Map*, *Match*, and *Merge* phases.  
- **Customer segments** (#3): Includes segments that were created around your customers. For more information on how to manually create additional segments, visit the **Segments** section.

### Next step
Many of the home page insights are dependent upon the completion of the data configuration process, and this process in turn is based on first loading data into Customer Insights. See the [Data Sources](pm-data-sources.md) topic to learn how to complete the data loading process.

Complete these steps before you start building insights on top of your data.
