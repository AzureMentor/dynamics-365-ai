[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The home page is the first page you see in the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights app.

If you are a trial user, make sure you switch from a demo environment before starting to use the product. This can be done via the environment switcher that is positioned in the upper-right corner of the page.

## Exploring the home page

The home page is designed to equip you with a holistic view around your unified customer base and provide you with metrics to track the health of your business. You will first need to take a few steps to onboard, configure, and enrich your data in order for the insights to show up in the home page. Through the data manager and unify processes, you will take datasets that are siloed and disconnected, and create a unified dataset of your customers. Then, you can use capabilities such as *Measures*, *Enrich Profiles*, and *Activities* to unlock richer insights. Lastly, you will use capabilities such as *Segments* and *Customer Card* to utilize and act upon the new insights.

The following image shows the types of insights you can expect to view on the home page.

Let's explore those insights.

- **Aggregate-level insights** (#1): Tiles with business insights (from the measures you define on the **Measures** screen, only *Business Measures* will show up here. Can include predictive key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average likelihood of a customer churn.
- **Information on preferred brands and interests within your customer base** (#2): This unique information can be unlocked via the **Enrich Profiles** page after completing the *Map*, *Match*, and *Merge* phases.  
- **Customer segments** (#3): Includes segments that were created around your customers. For more information on how to manually create additional segments, visit the **Segments** section.


## Next step
Many of the home page insights are dependent upon the completion of the data configuration process, and this process in turn is based on first loading data into Customer Insights. See the [Data Manager](pm-data-manager.md) or [Data Sources](pm-data-sources.md) topics to learn how to complete the data loading process. 

Complete these steps before you start building insights on top of your data.
