If you are a trial user, make sure to switch from a demo environment before starting to use the product. This can be done via the environment switcher that is positioned on the top-right corner of the page.

## Exploring the Home page

The **Home** page is designed to equip you with a holistic view around your unified customer base, and provide you with metrics to track the health of your business. You will first need to take a few steps to onboard, configure, and enrich your data in order for the insights to show up in the **Home** page. Through the *Data Manager* and *Configure Data* processes, you will take datasets that are siloed and disconnected, and create a unified dataset of your customers. Then, you can use capabilities such as *Measures*, *Enrich Profiles*, and *Activities* to unlock richer insights. Lastly, you will use capabilities such as *Segments* and *Customer Card* to utilize and act upon the new insights.

The image below shows the types of insights you can expect to view on the **Home** page.

Let's explore those insights.

- **Aggregate-level insights** (#1): Tiles with unique insights about your total customer base. May include predictive KPIs such as average likelihood of a customer churn.
- **Information on preferred brands and interests within your customer base** (#2): This unique information can be unlocked via the **Enrich Profiles** page after completing the *Map*, *Match* and *Merge* phases.  
- **Customer segments** (#3): Includes segments that were created around your customers. For more information on how to manually create additional segments, visit the **Segments** section.

## Next step
Many of the **Home** page insights are dependent upon the completion of the data configuration process and this process in turn is based on first loading data into Customer Insights. See the [Data Manager](pm-data-manager.md) or [Data Sources](pm-data-sources.md) topics to learn how to complete the data loading process. 

To get started, see the [Data Manager](pm-data-manager.md) and [Data Sources](pm-data-sources.md) topics to learn how to complete the data loading process. This is the first step before you can start building insights on top of your data.
