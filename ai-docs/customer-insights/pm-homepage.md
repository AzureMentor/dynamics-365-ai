# Home Page

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Home page** is the first page you see in the Customer Insights app. <!-- If you are an administrator and it's the first time you use Customer Insights, make sure to first go through the ***Onboarding Guide***. -->

## Exploring the Home page
The Home page is designed to equip you with a holistic view around your unified customer base. Through the data configuration process, you will use Customer Insights to take datasets that are siloed and disconnected and create a unified dataset of your customers. Then, you can use capabilities such as Segmentation, Customer Insights Dashboard and Timeline to unlock unique insights about your customers based on this unified dataset.

Many insights are dependent upon the completion of the data configuration process so few insights might show up initially on the Home page. Once you complete the data loading (see [Data Manager](pm-data-manager.md)) and data configuration processes, more insights will light up on the Home page. 

These are the types of insights displayed on the Home page:
- **Aggragate-level insights (#1 below):** Tiles with unique insights about your total customer base (including predictive KPIs such as average likelihood of a customer churn).
- **Customer profile list (#2 below):** Includes your customers' details - each profile is represented by a row. Note that this list represents only your most recent customers. For information on how to get a full list of customers, see [Data Manager: Entities](pm-entities.md).
- **Customer segments (#3 below):** Includes segments that were created around your customers. Note that some segments are auto-created by the system and will show up on the Home page prior to any manual segment creation. For information on how to manually create additional segments, see [Segments](pm-segments.md).

## Next step
Many of the Home page insights are dependent upon the completion of the data configuration process; this process is based on loading data into Customer Insights. See either the [Data Manager](pm-data-manager.md) or [Data Sources](pm-data-sources.md) topics to learn how to complete the data loading process.
