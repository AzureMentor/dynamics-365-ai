# APIs
*Note: this is a technical documentation. While it's purpose is to serve all users who wish to take advantage of the Customer 360 APIs, it might be most valuable for users in IT roles.

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

**When it comes to Customer 360**, at present there are several types of APIs that you can start utilize. The details of all our current and future APIs can be found in the following Swagger webpage:
https://dxt-wus-01.api.ci.ai.dynamics.com/swagger/index.html

- Provide a step-by-step guidance as for how to use and read the Swagger webpage shown above.
- Provide further explainations on the APIs that you, as a user, are expected to use the most.
