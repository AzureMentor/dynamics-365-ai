# Data Manager

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

<!--note from editor:  include what the function of Data Manager is here.  -->
Connecting to your data sources is the first step toward consolidating and reconciling customer data that was once disparate and conflicting. Data Manager includes two modules, **Data sources** and **Configure data**, shown here.

<!--note from editor:  Include links to the topics.  -->

The [Data sources](pm-data-sources.md) and [Common connectors guidance](pm-common-connectors.md) topics describe how to complete the mandatory data ingestion process by using the **Data sources** page. You learn how to connect to data from:

- Transactional sources
- Observational sources
- Behavioral sources
- Other sources 

<!--note from editor: in list above, give an example of each type of source ?  -->

>[!NOTE]
>Currently, on-premises data sources are not supported in Customer Insights.


<!--note from editor: are refs below to doc topics or to sections in the UI?   -->

Then, you can either:
- Start the data configuration process. Use the **Configure data** tile within the **Data Manager** page or the **Configure data** tab on the left-side menu. 
- Explore the data that you have just ingested through the **Entities** page.
