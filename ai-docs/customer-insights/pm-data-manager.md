# Data Manager

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Data Manager includes two modules: **Data sources** and **Configure data**, as shown here.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/data-manager-get-data-tile.png "Get data tile")

In the next two Data Manager sections ("Data sources" and "Common connectors guidance"), we will explain how to bring data from many of your sources:

- Transactional sources
- Observational sources
- Behavioral sources
- Any other data you might have 

Connecting to your data sources is the first step toward unlocking one of the unique promises behind Customer Insightsâ€”consolidating and reconciling data on your customers from multiple sources that were once disparate and conflicting. 

In the [Data sources](pm-data-sources.md) and [Common connectors guidance](pm-common-connectors.md) topics, you will learn how to complete the mandatory data ingestion process via the **Data sources** page.

**Note**: Currently, on-premises data sources are not supported in Customer Insights. 

<!--note from editor: are refs below to doc topics or to sections in the UI?   -->

Then, you can either:
- Start the data configuration process (accessible both via the **Configure data** tile within the **Data Manager** page, and via the **Configure data** tab on the left-side menu). After completing the **Data Sources** section, review the **Configure Data** section.
- Or, explore the data that you have just ingested through the **Entities** page. Once you've completed the **Data Sources** section, review the **Entities** section.
