# Data Manager

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Data Manager is the first page you will see upon entering the Customer 360 app. If it's the first time you are using Customer 360, make sure you first went through the *Onboarding Guide*. All product sections are accessed through their corresponding tab names in the left-side menu of the app as shown below.

## Data Manager sections: Get Data and Entities

In these sections, we explain how to bring data from many of your sources: 

- CRM systems
- transactional and survey data
- clickstream
- social
- other data you might have 

Connecting your data sources is the first step towards unlocking one of the unique product promises - consolidating and reconciling data on your customers from multiple sources that once were disparate and conflicting. 

Data Manager includes two modules: Get Data and Entities. In the [Get Data](pm-get-data.md) topic, you'll learn how to complete the mandatory data ingestion process. Then, you can either continue to the data configuration process or explore the data that you have ingested through the Entities module.
