# Data Manager

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this section we will explain how to bring data from many of your sources: 
- CRM systems
- transactional and survey data
- clickstream
- social
- other data you might have. 

Connecting your data sources is the first step towards unlocking one of the unique product promises - consolidating and reconciling data on your customers from multiple sources that once were disparate and conflicting. 

Data Manager includes two modules: Get Data and Entities. In the [Get Data](pm-get-data.md) topic, you'll learn how to complete the mandatory data ingestion process. Then, you can either continue to the data configuration process or explore the data that you have ingested through the Entities module.
