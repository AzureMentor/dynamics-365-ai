# Unify

After completing the data ingestion process, you are ready to unlock the unique data-unification features that Dynamics 365 Customer Insights offers. In Customer Insights, data unification includes three pages: **Map**, **Match**, and **Merge**.
 
The goal behind the data unification process is to unify data sources that were once disparate into a master customer dataset that provides a more complete view of your customers. You should complete the three mandatory data unification stagesâ€”start with *map*, continue with *match*, and finish with *merge*.

After completing the three data-unification phases, you might want to use the optional **Relationships**, **Enrichment**, and **Activities** pages.
- The **Relationships** page is highly recommended for creating segments on the **Segments** page. Visit the **Relationships** section to learn more.
- The **Enrichment** page is highly recommended for extracting richer insights about your customers. Visit the **Enrichment** section to learn more.
- The **Activities** page can be used to define some of your ingested attributes as activities. Visit the **Activities** section to learn more.
