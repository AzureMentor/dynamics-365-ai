# Configure data

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)

After completing the data ingestion process, you are ready to unlock the unique data-unification features that Dynamics 365 Customer Insights offers. **Unify** includes three modules, represented by tiles in the screen shown later in this topic.
 
The goal behind the data unification process is to unify data sources that were once disparate into a master customer dataset that includes a more complete view on your customers. You should complete the three mandatory data unification stages. Start with **Map**, and continue with **Match** and **Merge**.

After completing the data-unification phases, you may want to utilize the optional **Relationships**, **Enrich Profiles**, and **Activities** screens.
- The **Relationship** module is optional but is highly recommended for future utilization of the **Segments** page, where you will produce customer segments. This can be done only after the completion of **Map**, **Match**, and **Merge**.
- The **Enrich Profiles** module is also optional but highly recommended for extracting richer insights about your customers. 
- The **Activities** module can be used to define some of your ingested attributes as activities.
