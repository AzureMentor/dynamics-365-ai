# Unify

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)

After completing the data ingestion process, you are ready to unlock the unique data-unification features that Dynamics 365 Customer Insights offers. The **Unify** page includes three modules: **Map**, **Match**, and **Merge**.
 
The goal behind the data unification process is to unify data sources that were once disparate into a master customer dataset that provides a more complete view of your customers. You should complete the three mandatory data unification stagesâ€”start with *map*, continue with *match*, and finish with *merge*.

<!--note from editor:  Intro calls them "pages", bullets call them "modules". Nimrod will handle  -->

After completing the data-unification phases, you might want to use the optional **Relationships**, **Enrich profiles**, and **Activities** pages.
- The **Relationships** module is highly recommended for future utilization of the **Segments** page, where you will produce customer segments. This can be done only after the completion of the *map*, *match*, and *merge* phases.
- The **Enrich profiles** module is highly recommended for extracting richer insights about your customers. 
- The **Activities** module can be used to define some of your ingested attributes as activities.

<!--note from editor:  The function of the modules in first and second bullets above isn't clear. Nimrod will handle  -->
