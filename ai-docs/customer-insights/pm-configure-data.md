# Configure data

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)

Once ingested your data, you are ready to unlock the unique data-configuration features that Customer Insights offers. **Configure Data** includes six modules as represented by the tiles at the screen below.
 
The goal behind the data configuration process is to unify data sources that once were disparate into a master customer dataset that includes a more complete information on your customers.  

- You should complete the three mandatory data configuration stages: Starting with **Map**, and continuing with **Match** and **Merge**. As a next step make sure to explore those modules' sections, starting with the **Map** section.
- The **Relationship** module is optional but highly recommended for future utilization of the **Segments** screen where you will produce customer segments (can be done only upon the completion of *Map*, *Match* and *Merge*)
- The **Enrich Profiles** module is also optional but highly recommended for extracting richer insights around your customers 
- Lastly, the **Activities** module can be used to define some of your ingested attributes as activities

After completing the mandatory configuration phases, visit the **Relationships**, **Enrich Profiles** and **Activities** sections to learn more on each of these modules.
