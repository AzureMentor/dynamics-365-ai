# Customer Card add-in

The Customer Card enables you to gain a 360-degree view on each of your customers. Once the Customer Card installation is complete, you can start using the **Timeline Control** and **Demographic Control** to unlock rich insights on selected customers, including their location, age, latest activities, and more. Note that a prerequisite to using the Customer Card is use of the **Search & Filter Index** screen (accessible via the **Customers** page) to index your data. Also note that:
- In order to view customer activities, those should be first defined using the **Activities** screen.
- In order to view customer KPIs, those should be first defined using the **Measures** screen. 

## Requirements

- Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service), version 9.0 and later.
- Unified Interface enabled: Sales Hub, Customer Service Hub, Project Resource Hub. 
- Users who will use the Customer Insights Customer Card in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 need to be added as users on Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. You can do so on the **Permissions** page in the **Admin** section, as discussed later in this topic.

## Install Customer Card Add-in

1. As an admin, go to the **Settings** section in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, and select **Solutions**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Settings solutions](media/settings-solutions.png "Settings solutions")

2. Select the display name link for the Customer Insights solution.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select display name](media/select-display-name.png "Select display name")

   If the Customer Insights solution does not appear in your list of solutions, select **Get Solutions from Marketplace** above the list. This will take you to Microsoft AppSource. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Get Solutions from Marketplace](media/get-solutions-from-marketplace2.png "Get Solutions from Marketplace")


   In Microsoft AppSource, search for the Dynamics Customer Card and select **Get It Now**. It may take some time for the solution to be installed to your environment. 

3. Here you will configure the overall settings for the Customer Card add-in. The first step is to sign in with the admin Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account you use to configure Customer Insights.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Check that the browser pop-up blocker does not block the authentication window when you select the **Authenticate** button. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Log in with org credentials](media/login-with-org-credentials.png "Log in with org credentials")

4. The next step is to select the Customer Insights instance you want to fetch data from.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select instance to connect to](media/select-instance-to-connect.png "Select instance to connect to")

5. The last step on the overall setting is to select which field in the Customer Insights Customer entity corresponds to the ID of the Contact entity in your model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 organization. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Contact ID field](media/contact-id-field.png "Contact ID field")
  
    For associating an Account form to an Organization, you can select the Customers Insights Customer entity that corresponds to the Organization ID (CompanyId in this case).
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Contact ID field](media/customer-card-add-in-b2b.png "Account ID field")


6. Select **Save configuration** to save the setting. 

7. Next, you will need to assign the following user roles:

   - Customer Insights Card Customizer: Assign this role to the users who will customize the content to be shown on the card for the whole organization.
   - Customer Insights Card Standard User: Assign this role to the users who will use the card for consumption, but who wonâ€™t customize. 
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Manage user roles](media/manage-user-roles.png "Manage user roles")

8. Now you can add the Customer Card controls into your contact form. To do so, go to the **Settings** section in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, and then select **Customizations**. 
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Settings customizations](media/settings-customizations.png "Settings customizations")

9. Select **Customize the System**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Customize the System](media/settings-customize-system.png "Customize the System")

10.	Browse to the Contact entity, expand its menu, and then select **Forms**. 
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Expand Contact entity menu](media/contact-entity-definition.png "Expand Contact entity menu")

11. Select the contact form to which you would like to add the Customer Card controls.
