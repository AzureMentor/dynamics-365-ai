# Customer Card add-in

The Customer Card add-in gives you a 360-degree view of each of your customers. Once installed, you can start using  **Timeline Control** and **Demographic Control** to unlock rich insights on selected customers, including their location, age, latest activities, and more.

Note that a prerequisite to using the Customer Card is use of the **Search & Filter Index** screen (accessible via the **Customers** page) to index your data. Also note that:

- To view customer activities, they should first be defined using the **Activities** screen.
- To view customer KPIs, they should first be defined using the **Measures** screen.

## Requirements

- Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service), version 9.0 and later.
- Unified Interface enabled: Sales Hub, Customer Service Hub, Project Resource Hub.
- Individuals who will use the Customer Card in model-driven Dynamics 365 apps need to be added as users. You can do so on the Customer Insights **Permissions** page in the **Admin** section, as discussed later in this topic.

## Install Customer Card Add-in

1. As an admin, go to the **Settings** section in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, and select **Solutions**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Settings solutions](media/settings-solutions.png "Settings solutions")

2. Select the **Display Name** link for the Customer Insights solution.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select display name](media/select-display-name.png "Select display name")

   If the Customer Insights solution does not appear in your list of solutions, select **Get Solutions from Marketplace** above the list. This will take you to Microsoft AppSource.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Get Solutions from Marketplace](media/get-solutions-from-marketplace2.png "Get Solutions from Marketplace")

   In Microsoft AppSource, search for the Dynamics Customer Card and select **Get It Now**. It may take some time for the solution to be installed to your environment.

3. Here you will configure the overall settings for the Customer Card add-in. Sign in with the admin Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account you use to configure Customer Insights.

   > Check that the browser pop-up blocker does not block the authentication window when you select the **Authenticate** button.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

4. Select the Customer Insights instance you want to fetch data from.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select instance to connect to](media/select-instance-to-connect.png "Select instance to connect to")

5. Select the field in the Customer Insights Customer entity that matches the ID of your Contact entity.

   > ![Contact ID field](media/contact-id-field.png "Contact ID field")

6. Select **Save configuration** to save the setting.

<!-- Is it sufficiently clear how to assign user roles? -->
7. Next, assign the following user roles:

   - **Customer Insights Card Customizer**: Assign this role to users who will customize the content shown on the card for the whole organization.
   - **Customer Insights Card Standard User**: Assign this role to users who will use the card for consumption, but who wonâ€™t customize.
  
8. Now you can add the Customer Card controls into your contact form. To do so, go to the **Settings** section in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, and then select **Customizations**.
