# Create a Customer Insights instance

This article explains how to create a Dynamics 365 Customer Insights instance and how to provision an environment.

## Sign up for Customer Insights and create the first instance

<!-- worth creating a separate topic to sign up the first time for a Get started node and keep environment creation under the admin node?-->

1. In your browser, go to the [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/) website.

2. Select **Get Started**.

3. Choose your preferred sign-up scenario and select the corresponding link.

4. You may need to accept the terms and conditions and select **Continue** to start creating the instance.

5. After the environment is created, you'll be redirected to [your Customer Insights instance](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com).

6. You can use the demo environment to explore the app, or create a new environment. Learn more about specifying the settings to create an environment.

7. After specifying the environment settings, select **Create**.

8. You'll be signed in to Customer Insights when the environment was created successfully.

## Create an environment from an existing Customer Insights instance

1. Select the **Settings** symbol in the header of the app.

<!--why not under Admin in left nav?-->

2. Select **Environments**.

3. In the panel on the right side of the screen, select **New environment**.

4. Specify the basic and advanced settings and select **Create** to create the environment.

## New environment settings

When you create a new environment, you can specify basic settings, and optionally, some advanced settings.

1. In the **Create new environment** dialog, provide the following details:
   - **Display name**: The name that represents this enviroment in the Customer Insights app
   - **Region**: The region into which the service is deployed and hosted
   - **Type**: Select if you want to create a Production environment or a Sandbox environment

2. Optionally, you can select **Advanced** to configure additional settings:
<!--could use an image-->
   - **Storage**: Specifies where you want to store the output data generated from Customer Insights. You'll have two options: **Customer Insights storage** (am Azure Data Lake managed by the Customer Insights team) and **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (your own Azure Data Lake storage). By default, Customer Insights storage option is selected. 
   <!-- add a link when the BYODL docs go live-->
   > [!NOTE]
   > By saving data to Azure Data Lake Storage, you agree that data will be transferred to and stored in the appropriate geographic location for that Azure storage account, which may differ from where data is stored in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. [Learn more at the Microsoft Trust Center.](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center)    
   > Currently, ingested entities are always stored in the Customer Insights managed data lake.
   > We support only Azure Data Lake Gen2 Hierarchical Name Space (HNS) enabled storage accounts. Non-HNS storage accounts aren't supported yet.

   - For the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 option, you need to specify **Account name** and **Account key** for your storage account. The container name is always set to **customerinsights** and you can't change it.

   When you start performing operations in Customer Insights like data ingestion, running data unification, creating segments, etc. the corresponding folders will get created in the storage account you specified above, and the data files and model.json files will get created and added to the respective sub-folders based on the operations you perform.

   If you create multiple instances of Customer Insights and choose to save the output entities from all those instances in your storage account, separate folders will be created for each instance with ci_<instanceid> in the container.

   
h.	Once you select to save CI output Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 option and create the instance, you will not be able to revert that setting. You can however update the Access key as needed. If you wish to change the storage option, you will need to delete the instance and create a new instance altogether.
Editing an existing environment setting
1.	Once you create an environment, you can edit the environment details like name etc.
2.	In the Environments panel, click on the ellipsis option and select Edit to edit the environment details.
3.	Only display name can be edited for an environment. Region and Type cannot be edited.
4.	(Preview) If an environment has a setting to save all output entities data to the customerâ€™s Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 option, only account key can be updated. Account name and Container name cannot be edited.
 
Deleting an existing environment
1.	In the Environments panel, click on the ellipsis option and select Delete to delete an environment.
2.	You will see a confirmation screen to confirm if you want to delete the environment and asks you to type in the environment name.
3.	Once you type in the environment name and click Delete, environment will be deleted, and you will see a confirmation message that the environment is deleted.
