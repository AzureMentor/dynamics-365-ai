After completing the Data Manager sections, you are ready to start benefiting from the various insights you have just unlocked on your customers. The *Profile* and *Segmentation* Customers sections are used for this purpose as well as the *Home* section that will be covered later.

Which of these three sections should you start with? That depends on your goal:
- To get a high-level view of the unique aspects of your customer base as a whole and the latest changes in those aspects, start with the *Home* page, and continue with the *Segmentation* and *Profile* pages (in that order).
- To start with more targeted insights â€“ insights around specific segments of your customer base, start with the *Segmentation* page or the *Enriched Data* page. 
- To understand specific customer aspects and trends, start with the *Profile* page.
- To analyze your top paying, engaged, or active customers, start with the *Profile* page.
